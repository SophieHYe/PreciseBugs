{"buggy_code": ["mbed TLS ChangeLog (Sorted per branch, date)\n\n= mbed TLS x.x.x branch released xxxx-xx-xx\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix a missing error detection in ECJPAKE. This could have caused a\n     predictable shared secret if a hardware accelerator failed and the other\n     side of the key exchange had a similar bug.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix to allow building test suites with any warning that detects unused\n     functions. Fixes #1628.\n   * Fix typo in net_would_block(). Fixes #528 reported by github-monoculture.\n   * Remove redundant include file in timing.c. Fixes #2640 reported by irwir.\n   * Fix Visual Studio Release x64 build configuration by inheriting\n     PlatformToolset from the project configuration. Fixes #1430 reported by\n     irwir.\n   * Enable Suite B with subset of ECP curves. Make sure the code compiles even\n     if some curves are not defined. Fixes #1591 reported by dbedev.\n   * Fix misuse of signed arithmetic in the HAVEGE module. #2598\n\nChanges\n   * Make `make clean` clean all programs always. Fixes #1862.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.11 branch released 2019-06-11\n\nSecurity\n   * Make mbedtls_ecdh_get_params return an error if the second key\n     belongs to a different group from the first. Before, if an application\n     passed keys that belonged to different group, the first key's data was\n     interpreted according to the second group, which could lead to either\n     an error or a meaningless output from mbedtls_ecdh_get_params. In the\n     latter case, this could expose at most 5 bits of the private key.\n\nBugfix\n   * Server's RSA certificate in certs.c was SHA-1 signed. In the default\n     mbedTLS configuration only SHA-2 signed certificates are accepted.\n     This certificate is used in the demo server programs, which lead the\n     client programs to fail at the peer's certificate verification\n     due to an unacceptable hash signature. The certificate has been\n     updated to one that is SHA-256 signed. Fix contributed by\n     Illya Gerasymchuk.\n   * Fix private key DER output in the key_app_writer example. File contents\n     were shifted by one byte, creating an invalid ASN.1 tag. Fixed by\n     Christian Walther in #2239.\n   * Fix potential memory leak in X.509 self test. Found and fixed by\n     Junhwan Park, #2106.\n   * Fix 1-byte buffer overflow in mbedtls_mpi_write_string() when\n     used with negative inputs. Found by Guido Vranken in #2404. Credit to\n     OSS-Fuzz.\n   * Fix bugs in the AEAD test suite which would be exposed by ciphers which\n     either used both encrypt and decrypt key schedules, or which perform padding.\n     GCM and CCM were not affected. Fixed by Jack Lloyd.\n   * Fix incorrect default port number in ssl_mail_client example's usage.\n     Found and fixed by irwir. #2337\n   * Add missing parentheses around parameters in the definition of the\n     public macro MBEDTLS_X509_ID_FLAG. This could lead to invalid evaluation\n     in case operators binding less strongly than subtraction were used\n     for the parameter.\n   * Add a check for MBEDTLS_X509_CRL_PARSE_C in ssl_server2, guarding the crl\n     sni entry parameter. Reported by inestlerode in #560.\n   * Fix missing bounds checks in X.509 parsing functions that could\n     lead to successful parsing of ill-formed X.509 CRTs. Fixes #2437.\n   * Fix multiple X.509 functions previously returning ASN.1 low-level error\n     codes to always wrap these codes into X.509 high level error codes before\n     returning. Fixes #2431.\n\nChanges\n   * Return from various debugging routines immediately if the\n     provided SSL context is unset.\n   * Remove dead code from bignum.c in the default configuration.\n     Found by Coverity, reported and fixed by Peter Kolbus (Garmin). Fixes #2309.\n   * Add test for minimal value of MBEDTLS_MPI_WINDOW_SIZE to all.sh.\n     Contributed by Peter Kolbus (Garmin).\n   * Change wording in the `mbedtls_ssl_conf_max_frag_len()`'s documentation to\n     improve clarity. Fixes #2258.\n   * Improve debug output of ssl_client2 and ssl_server2 in case suitable\n     test CRTs are available because MBEDTLS_PEM_PARSE_C is disabled.\n     Fixes #2254.\n   * Replace multiple uses of MD2 by SHA-256 in X.509 test suite. Fixes #821.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.10 branch released 2019-03-19\n\nFeatures\n   * Add MBEDTLS_REMOVE_3DES_CIPHERSUITES to allow removing 3DES ciphersuites\n     from the default list (enabled by default). See\n     https://sweet32.info/SWEET32_CCS16.pdf.\n\nBugfix\n   * Run the AD too long test only if MBEDTLS_CCM_ALT is not defined.\n     Raised as a comment in #1996.\n   * Fix returning the value 1 when mbedtls_ecdsa_genkey failed.\n   * Remove a duplicate #include in a sample program. Fixed by Masashi Honma #2326.\n   * Reduce stack usage of `mpi_write_hlp()` by eliminating recursion.\n     Fixes #2190.\n   * Ensure that unused bits are zero when writing ASN.1 bitstrings when using\n     mbedtls_asn1_write_bitstring().\n   * Fix issue when writing the named bitstrings in KeyUsage and NsCertType\n     extensions in CSRs and CRTs that caused these bitstrings to not be encoded\n     correctly as trailing zeroes were not accounted for as unused bits in the\n     leading content octet. Fixes #1610.\n\nChanges\n   * Include configuration file in all header files that use configuration,\n     instead of relying on other header files that they include.\n     Inserted as an enhancement for #1371\n   * Add support for alternative CSR headers, as used by Microsoft and defined\n     in RFC 7468. Found by Michael Ernst. Fixes #767.\n   * Fix clobber list in MIPS assembly for large integer multiplication.\n     Previously, this could lead to functionally incorrect assembly being\n     produced by some optimizing compilers, showing up as failures in\n     e.g. RSA or ECC signature operations. Reported in #1722, fix suggested\n     by Aurelien Jarno and submitted by Jeffrey Martin.\n   * Reduce the complexity of the timing tests. They were assuming more than the\n     underlying OS actually guarantees.\n   * Ciphersuites based on 3DES now have the lowest priority by default when\n     they are enabled.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.9 branch released 2018-12-21\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix for Clang, which was reporting a warning for the bignum.c inline\n     assembly for AMD64 targets creating string literals greater than those\n     permitted by the ISO C99 standard. Found by Aaron Jones. Fixes #482.\n   * Fix runtime error in `mbedtls_platform_entropy_poll()` when run\n     through qemu user emulation. Reported and fix suggested by randombit\n     in #1212. Fixes #1212.\n   * Fix an unsafe bounds check when restoring an SSL session from a ticket.\n     This could lead to a buffer overflow, but only in case ticket authentication\n     was broken. Reported and fix suggested by Guido Vranken in #659.\n   * Add explicit integer to enumeration type casts to example program\n     programs/pkey/gen_key which previously led to compilation failure\n     on some toolchains. Reported by phoenixmcallister. Fixes #2170.\n   * Clarify documentation of mbedtls_ssl_set_own_cert() regarding the absence\n     of check for certificate/key matching. Reported by Attila Molnar, #507.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.8 branch released 2018-11-30\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix timing variations and memory access variations in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5\n     decryption that could lead to a Bleichenbacher-style padding oracle\n     attack. In TLS, this affects servers that accept ciphersuites based on\n     RSA decryption (i.e. ciphersuites whose name contains RSA but not\n     (EC)DH(E)). Discovered by Eyal Ronen (Weizmann Institute),  Robert Gillham\n     (University of Adelaide), Daniel Genkin (University of Michigan),\n     Adi Shamir (Weizmann Institute), David Wong (NCC Group), and Yuval Yarom\n     (University of Adelaide, Data61). The attack is described in more detail\n     in the paper available here: http://cat.eyalro.net/cat.pdf  CVE-2018-19608\n   * In mbedtls_mpi_write_binary(), don't leak the exact size of the number\n     via branching and memory access patterns. An attacker who could submit\n     a plaintext for RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption but only observe the timing\n     of the decryption and not its result could nonetheless decrypt RSA\n     plaintexts and forge RSA signatures. Other asymmetric algorithms may\n     have been similarly vulnerable. Reported by Eyal Ronen, Robert Gillham,\n     Daniel Genkin, Adi Shamir, David Wong and Yuval Yarom.\n   * Wipe sensitive buffers on the stack in the CTR_DRBG and HMAC_DRBG\n     modules.\n\nAPI Changes\n   * The new functions mbedtls_ctr_drbg_update_ret() and\n     mbedtls_hmac_drbg_update_ret() are similar to mbedtls_ctr_drbg_update()\n     and mbedtls_hmac_drbg_update() respectively, but the new functions\n     report errors whereas the old functions return void. We recommend that\n     applications use the new functions.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.7 branch released 2018-11-19\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix overly strict DN comparison when looking for CRLs belonging to a\n     particular CA. This previously led to ignoring CRLs when the CRL's issuer\n     name and the CA's subject name differed in their string encoding (e.g.,\n     one using PrintableString and the other UTF8String) or in the choice of\n     upper and lower case. Reported by Henrik Andersson of Bosch GmbH in issue\n     #1784.\n   * Fix a flawed bounds check in server PSK hint parsing. In case the\n     incoming message buffer was placed within the first 64KiB of address\n     space and a PSK-(EC)DHE ciphersuite was used, this allowed an attacker\n     to trigger a memory access up to 64KiB beyond the incoming message buffer,\n     potentially leading to application crash or information disclosure.\n   * Fix mbedtls_mpi_is_prime() to use more rounds of probabilistic testing. The\n     previous settings for the number of rounds made it practical for an\n     adversary to construct non-primes that would be erroneously accepted as\n     primes with high probability. This does not have an impact on the\n     security of TLS, but can matter in other contexts with numbers chosen\n     potentially by an adversary that should be prime and can be validated.\n     For example, the number of rounds was enough to securely generate RSA key\n     pairs or Diffie-Hellman parameters, but was insufficient to validate\n     Diffie-Hellman parameters properly.\n     See \"Prime and Prejudice\" by by Martin R. Albrecht and Jake Massimo and\n     Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj Somorovsky.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix failure in hmac_drbg in the benchmark sample application, when\n     MBEDTLS_THREADING_C is defined. Found by TrinityTonic, #1095\n   * Fix a bug in the update function for SSL ticket keys which previously\n     invalidated keys of a lifetime of less than a 1s. Fixes #1968.\n   * Fix a bug in the record decryption routine ssl_decrypt_buf()\n     which led to accepting properly authenticated but improperly\n     padded records in case of CBC ciphersuites using Encrypt-then-MAC.\n   * Fix wrong order of freeing in programs/ssl/ssl_server2 example\n     application leading to a memory leak in case both\n     MBEDTLS_MEMORY_BUFFER_ALLOC_C and MBEDTLS_MEMORY_BACKTRACE are set.\n     Fixes #2069.\n   * Fix memory leak and freeing without initialization in the example\n     program programs/x509/cert_write. Fixes #1422.\n   * Ignore IV in mbedtls_cipher_set_iv() when the cipher mode is\n     MBEDTLS_MODE_ECB. Found by ezdevelop. Fixes for #1091.\n   * Zeroize memory used for reassembling handshake messages after use.\n   * Use `mbedtls_zeroize()` instead of `memset()` for zeroization of\n     sensitive data in the example programs aescrypt2 and crypt_and_hash.\n   * Fix compilation failure for configurations which use compile time\n     replacements of standard calloc/free functions through the macros\n     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_CALLOC_MACRO and MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_FREE_MACRO.\n     Reported by ole-de and ddhome2006. Fixes #882, #1642 and #1706.\n\nChanges\n   * Add tests for session resumption in DTLS.\n   * Close a test gap in (D)TLS between the client side and the server side:\n     test the handling of large packets and small packets on the client side\n     in the same way as on the server side.\n   * Change the dtls_client and dtls_server samples to work by default over\n     IPv6 and optionally by a build option over IPv4.\n   * Change the use of Windows threading to use Microsoft Visual C++ runtime\n     calls, rather than Win32 API calls directly. This is necessary to avoid\n     conflict with C runtime usage. Found and fixed by irwir.\n   * Improve documentation of mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result().\n     Fixes #517 reported by github-monoculture.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.6 branch released 2018-08-31\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix an issue in the X.509 module which could lead to a buffer overread\n     during certificate extensions parsing. In case of receiving malformed\n     input (extensions length field equal to 0), an illegal read of one byte\n     beyond the input buffer is made. Found and analyzed by Nathan Crandall.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix a potential memory leak in mbedtls_ssl_setup() function. An allocation\n     failure in the function could lead to other buffers being leaked.\n   * Fixes a missing test dependency on MBEDTLS_ARC4_C. #1890\n   * Fix a memory leak in ecp_mul_comb() if ecp_precompute_comb() fails.\n     Fix contributed by Espressif Systems.\n   * Add ecc extensions only if an ecc based ciphersuite is used.\n     This improves compliance to RFC 4492, and as a result, solves\n     interoperability issues with BouncyCastle. Raised by milenamil in #1157.\n   * Fix potential use-after-free in mbedtls_ssl_get_max_frag_len()\n     and mbedtls_ssl_get_record_expansion() after a session reset. Fixes #1941.\n   * Fix a miscalculation of the maximum record expansion in\n     mbedtls_ssl_get_record_expansion() in case of CBC ciphersuites\n     in (D)TLS versions 1.1 or higher. Fixes #1914.\n   * Fix a bug that caused SSL/TLS clients to incorrectly abort the handshake\n     with TLS versions 1.1 and earlier when the server requested authentication\n     without providing a list of CAs. This was due to an overly strict bounds\n     check in parsing the CertificateRequest message, introduced in\n     Mbed TLS 2.12.0. Fixes #1954.\n   * Fix undefined shifts with negative values in certificates parsing\n     (found by Catena cyber using oss-fuzz)\n   * Fix memory leak and free without initialization in pk_encrypt\n     and pk_decrypt example programs. Reported by Brace Stout. Fixes #1128.\n\nChanges\n   * Improve compatibility with some alternative CCM implementations by using\n     CCM test vectors from RAM.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.5 branch released 2018-07-25\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix a vulnerability in TLS ciphersuites based on CBC and using SHA-384,\n     in (D)TLS 1.0 to 1.2, that allowed an active network attacker to\n     partially recover the plaintext of messages under some conditions by\n     exploiting timing measurements. With DTLS, the attacker could perform\n     this recovery by sending many messages in the same connection. With TLS\n     or if mbedtls_ssl_conf_dtls_badmac_limit() was used, the attack only\n     worked if the same secret (for example a HTTP Cookie) has been repeatedly\n     sent over connections manipulated by the attacker. Connections using GCM\n     or CCM instead of CBC, using hash sizes other than SHA-384, or using\n     Encrypt-then-Mac (RFC 7366) were not affected. The vulnerability was\n     caused by a miscalculation (for SHA-384) in a countermeasure to the\n     original Lucky 13 attack. Found by Kenny Paterson, Eyal Ronen and Adi\n     Shamir.\n   * Fix a vulnerability in TLS ciphersuites based on CBC, in (D)TLS 1.0 to\n     1.2, that allowed a local attacker, able to execute code on the local\n     machine as well as manipulate network packets, to partially recover the\n     plaintext of messages under some conditions by using a cache attack\n     targeting an internal MD/SHA buffer. With TLS or if\n     mbedtls_ssl_conf_dtls_badmac_limit() was used, the attack only worked if\n     the same secret (for example a HTTP Cookie) has been repeatedly sent over\n     connections manipulated by the attacker. Connections using GCM or CCM\n     instead of CBC or using Encrypt-then-Mac (RFC 7366) were not affected.\n     Found by Kenny Paterson, Eyal Ronen and Adi Shamir.\n   * Add a counter-measure against a vulnerability in TLS ciphersuites based\n     on CBC, in (D)TLS 1.0 to 1.2, that allowed a local attacker, able to\n     execute code on the local machine as well as manipulate network packets,\n     to partially recover the plaintext of messages under some conditions (see\n     previous entry) by using a cache attack targeting the SSL input record\n     buffer. Connections using GCM or CCM instead of CBC or using\n     Encrypt-then-Mac (RFC 7366) were not affected. Found by Kenny Paterson,\n     Eyal Ronen and Adi Shamir.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix compilation error on C++, because of a variable named new.\n     Found and fixed by Hirotaka Niisato in #1783.\n   * Fix the inline assembly for the MPI multiply helper function for i386 and\n     i386 with SSE2. Found by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lang\u00f3. Fixes #1550\n   * Fix a memory leak in mbedtls_x509_csr_parse(), found by catenacyber,\n     Philippe Antoine. Fixes #1623.\n   * Clarify documentation for mbedtls_ssl_write() to include 0 as a valid\n     return value. Found by @davidwu2000. #839\n   * Fix the key_app_writer example which was writing a leading zero byte which\n     was creating an invalid ASN.1 tag. Found by Aryeh R. Fixes #1257.\n   * Remove unused headers included in x509.c. Found by Chris Hanson and fixed\n     by Brendan Shanks. Part of a fix for #992.\n   * Fix compilation error when MBEDTLS_ARC4_C is disabled and\n     MBEDTLS_CIPHER_NULL_CIPHER is enabled. Found by TrinityTonic in #1719.\n   * Added length checks to some TLS parsing functions. Found and fixed by\n     Philippe Antoine from Catena cyber. #1663.\n   * Fix namespacing in header files. Remove the `mbedtls` namespacing in\n     the `#include` in the header files. Resolves #857\n   * Fix compiler warning of 'use before initialisation' in\n     mbedtls_pk_parse_key(). Found by Martin Boye Petersen and fixed by Dawid\n     Drozd. #1098\n   * Fix decryption for zero length messages (which contain all padding) when a\n     CBC based ciphersuite is used together with Encrypt-then-MAC. Previously,\n     such a message was wrongly reported as an invalid record and therefore lead\n     to the connection being terminated. Seen most often with OpenSSL using\n     TLS 1.0. Reported by @kFYatek and by Conor Murphy on the forum. Fix\n     contributed by Espressif Systems. Fixes #1632\n   * Fix ssl_client2 example to send application data with 0-length content\n     when the request_size argument is set to 0 as stated in the documentation.\n     Fixes #1833.\n   * Correct the documentation for `mbedtls_ssl_get_session()`. This API has\n     deep copy of the session, and the peer certificate is not lost. Fixes #926.\n\nChanges\n   * Fail when receiving a TLS alert message with an invalid length, or invalid\n     zero-length messages when using TLS 1.2. Contributed by Espressif Systems.\n   * Change the shebang line in Perl scripts to look up perl in the PATH.\n     Contributed by fbrosson in #1533.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.4 branch released 2018-06-18\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix redundant declaration of mbedtls_ssl_list_ciphersuites. Raised by\n     TrinityTonic. #1359.\n   * Fix for redefinition of _WIN32_WINNT to avoid overriding a definition\n     used by user applications. Found and fixed by Fabio Alessandrelli.\n   * Fix braces in mbedtls_memory_buffer_alloc_status(). Found by sbranden, #552.\n   * Fix an issue with MicroBlaze support in bn_mul.h which was causing the\n     build to fail. Found by zv-io. Fixes #1651.\n   * Fix compilation warnings with IAR toolchain, on 32 bit platform.\n     Reported by rahmanih in #683\n\nChanges\n   * Support TLS testing in out-of-source builds using cmake. Fixes #1193.\n   * Changed CMake defaults for IAR to treat all compiler warnings as errors.\n   * Changed the Clang parameters used in the CMake build files to work for\n     versions later than 3.6. Versions of Clang earlier than this may no longer\n     work. Fixes #1072\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.3 branch released 2018-04-30\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix an issue in the X.509 module which could lead to a buffer overread\n     during certificate validation. Additionally, the issue could also lead to\n     unnecessary callback checks being made or to some validation checks to be\n     omitted. The overread could be triggered remotely, while the other issues\n     would require a non DER-compliant certificate to be correctly signed by a\n     trusted CA, or a trusted CA with a non DER-compliant certificate. Found by\n     luocm. Fixes #825.\n   * Fix the buffer length assertion in the ssl_parse_certificate_request()\n     function which led to an arbitrary overread of the message buffer. The\n     overreads could be caused by receiving a malformed message at the point\n     where an optional signature algorithms list is expected when the signature\n     algorithms section is too short. In builds with debug output, the overread\n     data is output with the debug data.\n   * Fix a client-side bug in the validation of the server's ciphersuite choice\n     which could potentially lead to the client accepting a ciphersuite it didn't\n     offer or a ciphersuite that cannot be used with the TLS or DTLS version\n     chosen by the server. This could lead to corruption of internal data\n     structures for some configurations.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix a spurious uninitialized variable warning in cmac.c. Fix independently\n     contributed by Brian J Murray and David Brown.\n   * Add missing dependencies in test suites that led to build failures\n     in configurations that omit certain hashes or public-key algorithms.\n     Fixes #1040.\n   * Fix C89 incompatibility in benchmark.c. Contributed by Brendan Shanks.\n     #1353\n   * Add missing dependencies for MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE and\n     MBEDTLS_VERSION_FEATURES in some test suites. Contributed by\n     Deomid Ryabkov. Fixes #1299, #1475.\n   * Fix the Makefile build process for building shared libraries on Mac OS X.\n     Fixed by mnacamura.\n   * Fix parsing of PKCS#8 encoded Elliptic Curve keys. Previously Mbed TLS was\n     unable to parse keys which had only the optional parameters field of the\n     ECPrivateKey structure. Found by Jethro Beekman, fixed in #1379.\n   * Return the plaintext data more quickly on unpadded CBC decryption, as\n     stated in the mbedtls_cipher_update() documentation. Contributed by\n     Andy Leiserson.\n   * Fix overriding and ignoring return values when parsing and writing to\n     a file in pk_sign program. Found by kevlut in #1142.\n   * Fix buffer length assertions in the ssl_parse_certificate_request()\n     function which leads to a potential one byte overread of the message\n     buffer.\n   * Fix invalid buffer sizes passed to zlib during record compression and\n     decompression.\n\nChanges\n   * Support cmake builds where Mbed TLS is a subproject. Fix contributed\n     independently by Matthieu Volat and Arne Schwabe.\n   * Improve testing in configurations that omit certain hashes or\n     public-key algorithms. Includes contributions by Gert van Dijk.\n   * Improve negative testing of X.509 parsing.\n   * Do not define global mutexes around readdir() and gmtime() in\n     configurations where the feature is disabled. Found and fixed by Gergely\n     Budai.\n   * Provide an empty implementation of mbedtls_pkcs5_pbes2() when\n     MBEDTLS_ASN1_PARSE_C is not enabled. This allows the use of PBKDF2\n     without PBES2. Fixed by Marcos Del Sol Vives.\n   * Improve the documentation of mbedtls_net_accept(). Contributed by Ivan\n     Krylov.\n   * Improve the documentation of mbedtls_ssl_write(). Suggested by\n     Paul Sokolovsky in #1356.\n   * Add an option in the Makefile to support ar utilities where the operation\n     letter must not be prefixed by '-', such as LLVM. Found and fixed by\n     Alex Hixon.\n   * Allow configuring the shared library extension by setting the DLEXT\n     environment variable when using the project makefiles.\n   * In the SSL module, when f_send, f_recv or f_recv_timeout report\n     transmitting more than the required length, return an error. Raised by\n     Sam O'Connor in #1245.\n   * Improve robustness of mbedtls_ssl_derive_keys against the use of\n     HMAC functions with non-HMAC ciphersuites. Independently contributed\n     by Jiayuan Chen in #1377.

Submitted by Antonio Quartulli,\n     OpenVPN Inc. Fixes #1339\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix setting version TLSv1 as minimal version, even if TLS 1\n     is not enabled. Set MBEDTLS_SSL_MIN_MAJOR_VERSION\n     and MBEDTLS_SSL_MIN_MINOR_VERSION instead of\n     MBEDTLS_SSL_MAJOR_VERSION_3 and MBEDTLS_SSL_MINOR_VERSION_1. #664\n   * Fix compilation error on Mingw32 when _TRUNCATE is defined. Use _TRUNCATE\n     only if __MINGW32__ not defined.

This means\n     that when both sides of a TLS connection negotiate the truncated\n     HMAC extension, Mbed TLS can now interoperate with other\n     compliant implementations, but this breaks interoperability with\n     prior versions of Mbed TLS. To restore the old behavior, enable\n     the (deprecated) option MBEDTLS_SSL_TRUNCATED_HMAC_COMPAT in\n     config.h. Found by Andreas Walz (ivESK, Offenburg University of\n     Applied Sciences).\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix implementation of the truncated HMAC extension. The previous\n     implementation allowed an offline 2^80 brute force attack on the\n     HMAC key of a single, uninterrupted connection (with no\n     resumption of the session).\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix the name of a DHE parameter that was accidentally changed in 2.7.0.\n     Fixes #1358.\n   * Fix test_suite_pk to work on 64-bit ILP32 systems. #849\n   * Fix mbedtls_x509_crt_profile_suiteb, which used to reject all certificates\n     with flag MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_BAD_PK even when the key type was correct.\n     In the context of SSL, this resulted in handshake failure.

When the truncated HMAC extension is enabled and CBC is used,\n     sending a malicious application packet could be used to selectively corrupt\n     6 bytes on the peer's heap, which could potentially lead to crash or remote\n     code execution. The issue could be triggered remotely from either side in\n     both TLS and DTLS. CVE-2018-0488\n   * Fix a buffer overflow in RSA-PSS verification when the hash was too large\n     for the key size, which could potentially lead to crash or remote code\n     execution. Found by Seth Terashima, Qualcomm Product Security Initiative,\n     Qualcomm Technologies Inc. CVE-2018-0487\n   * Fix buffer overflow in RSA-PSS verification when the unmasked data is all\n     zeros.\n   * Fix an unsafe bounds check in ssl_parse_client_psk_identity() when adding\n     64 KiB to the address of the SSL buffer and causing a wrap around.\n   * Fix a potential heap buffer overflow in mbedtls_ssl_write(). When the (by\n     default enabled) maximum fragment length extension is disabled in the\n     config and the application data buffer passed to mbedtls_ssl_write\n     is larger than the internal message buffer (16384 bytes by default), the\n     latter overflows. The exploitability of this issue depends on whether the\n     application layer can be forced into sending such large packets. The issue\n     was independently reported by Tim Nordell via e-mail and by Florin Petriuc\n     and sjorsdewit on GitHub. Fix proposed by Florin Petriuc in #1022.\n     Fixes #707.\n   * Add a provision to prevent compiler optimizations breaking the time\n     constancy of mbedtls_ssl_safer_memcmp().\n   * Ensure that buffers are cleared after use if they contain sensitive data.\n     Changes were introduced in multiple places in the library.\n   * Set PEM buffer to zero before freeing it, to avoid decoded private keys\n     being leaked to memory after release.\n   * Fix dhm_check_range() failing to detect trivial subgroups and potentially\n     leaking 1 bit of the private key. Reported by prashantkspatil.\n   * Make mbedtls_mpi_read_binary() constant-time with respect to the input\n     data. Previously, trailing zero bytes were detected and omitted for the\n     sake of saving memory, but potentially leading to slight timing\n     differences. Reported by Marco Macchetti, Kudelski Group.\n   * Wipe stack buffer temporarily holding EC private exponent\n     after keypair generation.\n   * Fix a potential heap buffer over-read in ALPN extension parsing\n     (server-side). Could result in application crash, but only if an ALPN\n     name larger than 16 bytes had been configured on the server.\n   * Change default choice of DHE parameters from untrustworthy RFC 5114\n     to RFC 3526 containing parameters generated in a nothing-up-my-sleeve\n     manner.\n\nFeatures\n   * Allow comments in test data files.\n   * The selftest program can execute a subset of the tests based on command\n     line arguments.\n   * New unit tests for timing. Improve the self-test to be more robust\n     when run on a heavily-loaded machine.\n   * Add alternative implementation support for CCM and CMAC (MBEDTLS_CCM_ALT,\n     MBEDTLS_CMAC_ALT). Submitted by Steven Cooreman, Silicon Labs.\n   * Add support for alternative implementations of GCM, selected by the\n     configuration flag MBEDTLS_GCM_ALT.\n   * Add support for alternative implementations for ECDSA, controlled by new\n     configuration flags MBEDTLS_ECDSA_SIGN_ALT, MBEDTLS_ECDSA_VERIFY_ALT and\n     MBEDTLS_ECDSDA_GENKEY_AT in config.h.\n     The following functions from the ECDSA module can be replaced\n     with alternative implementation:\n     mbedtls_ecdsa_sign(), mbedtls_ecdsa_verify() and mbedtls_ecdsa_genkey().\n   * Add support for alternative implementation of ECDH, controlled by the\n     new configuration flags MBEDTLS_ECDH_COMPUTE_SHARED_ALT and\n     MBEDTLS_ECDH_GEN_PUBLIC_ALT in config.h.\n     The following functions from the ECDH module can be replaced\n     with an alternative implementation:\n     mbedtls_ecdh_gen_public() and mbedtls_ecdh_compute_shared().\n   * Add support for alternative implementation of ECJPAKE, controlled by\n     the new configuration flag MBEDTLS_ECJPAKE_ALT.\n   * Add mechanism to provide alternative implementation of the DHM module.\n\nAPI Changes\n   * Extend RSA interface by multiple functions allowing structure-\n     independent setup and export of RSA contexts. Most notably,\n     mbedtls_rsa_import() and mbedtls_rsa_complete() are introduced for setting\n     up RSA contexts from partial key material and having them completed to the\n     needs of the implementation automatically. This allows to setup private RSA\n     contexts from keys consisting of N,D,E only, even if P,Q are needed for the\n     purpose or CRT and/or blinding.\n   * The configuration option MBEDTLS_RSA_ALT can be used to define alternative\n     implementations of the RSA interface declared in rsa.h.\n   * The following functions in the message digest modules (MD2, MD4, MD5,\n     SHA1, SHA256, SHA512) have been deprecated and replaced as shown below.\n     The new functions change the return type from void to int to allow\n     returning error codes when using MBEDTLS_<MODULE>_ALT.\n     mbedtls_<MODULE>_starts() -> mbedtls_<MODULE>_starts_ret()\n     mbedtls_<MODULE>_update() -> mbedtls_<MODULE>_update_ret()\n     mbedtls_<MODULE>_finish() -> mbedtls_<MODULE>_finish_ret()\n     mbedtls_<MODULE>_process() -> mbedtls_internal_<MODULE>_process()\n\nNew deprecations\n   * Deprecate usage of RSA primitives with non-matching key-type\n     (e.g. signing with a public key).\n   * Direct manipulation of structure fields of RSA contexts is deprecated.\n     Users are advised to use the extended RSA API instead.\n   * Deprecate usage of message digest functions that return void\n     (mbedtls_<MODULE>_starts, mbedtls_<MODULE>_update,\n     mbedtls_<MODULE>_finish and mbedtls_<MODULE>_process where <MODULE> is\n     any of MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512) in favor of functions\n     that can return an error code.\n   * Deprecate untrustworthy DHE parameters from RFC 5114. Superseded by\n     parameters from RFC 3526 or the newly added parameters from RFC 7919.\n   * Deprecate hex string DHE constants MBEDTLS_DHM_RFC3526_MODP_2048_P etc.\n     Supserseded by binary encoded constants MBEDTLS_DHM_RFC3526_MODP_2048_P_BIN\n     etc.\n   * Deprecate mbedtls_ssl_conf_dh_param() for setting default DHE parameters\n     from hex strings. Superseded by mbedtls_ssl_conf_dh_param_bin()\n     accepting DHM parameters in binary form, matching the new constants.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix ssl_parse_record_header() to silently discard invalid DTLS records\n     as recommended in RFC 6347 Section 4.1.2.7.\n   * Fix memory leak in mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname() when called multiple times.\n     Found by projectgus and jethrogb, #836.\n   * Fix usage help in ssl_server2 example. Found and fixed by Bei Lin.\n   * Parse signature algorithm extension when renegotiating. Previously,\n     renegotiated handshakes would only accept signatures using SHA-1\n     regardless of the peer's preferences, or fail if SHA-1 was disabled.\n   * Fix leap year calculation in x509_date_is_valid() to ensure that invalid\n     dates on leap years with 100 and 400 intervals are handled correctly. Found\n     by Nicholas Wilson. #694\n   * Fix some invalid RSA-PSS signatures with keys of size 8N+1 that were\n     accepted. Generating these signatures required the private key.\n   * Fix out-of-memory problem when parsing 4096-bit PKCS8-encrypted RSA keys.\n     Found independently by Florian in the mbed TLS forum and by Mishamax.\n     #878, #1019.\n   * Fix variable used before assignment compilation warnings with IAR\n     toolchain. Found by gkerrien38.\n   * Fix unchecked return codes from AES, DES and 3DES functions in\n     pem_aes_decrypt(), pem_des_decrypt() and pem_des3_decrypt() respectively.\n     If a call to one of the functions of the cryptographic primitive modules\n     failed, the error may not be noticed by the function\n     mbedtls_pem_read_buffer() causing it to return invalid values.

In\n     particular, don't require P,Q if neither CRT nor blinding are\n     used. Reported and fix proposed independently by satur9nine and sliai\n     on GitHub.\n   * Only run AES-192 self-test if AES-192 is available. Fixes #963.\n   * Tighten the RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code and remove the\n     undeclared dependency of the RSA module on the ASN.1 module.\n   * Update all internal usage of deprecated message digest functions to the\n     new ones with return codes. In particular, this modifies the\n     mbedtls_md_info_t structure. Propagate errors from these functions\n     everywhere except some locations in the ssl_tls.c module.\n   * Improve CTR_DRBG error handling by propagating underlying AES errors.\n   * Add MBEDTLS_ERR_XXX_HW_ACCEL_FAILED error codes for all cryptography\n     modules where the software implementation can be replaced by a hardware\n     implementation.\n   * Add explicit warnings for the use of MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA-1, DES and ARC4\n     throughout the library.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.6.0 branch released 2017-08-10\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix authentication bypass in SSL/TLS: when authmode is set to optional,\n     mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() would incorrectly return 0 when the peer's\n     X.509 certificate chain had more than MBEDTLS_X509_MAX_INTERMEDIATE_CA\n     (default: 8) intermediates, even when it was not trusted. This could be\n     triggered remotely from either side. (With authmode set to 'required'\n     (the default), the handshake was correctly aborted).\n   * Reliably wipe sensitive data after use in the AES example applications\n     programs/aes/aescrypt2 and programs/aes/crypt_and_hash.\n     Found by Laurent Simon.\n\nFeatures\n   * Add the functions mbedtls_platform_setup() and mbedtls_platform_teardown()\n     and the context struct mbedtls_platform_context to perform\n     platform-specific setup and teardown operations. The macro\n     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_SETUP_TEARDOWN_ALT allows the functions to be overridden\n     by the user in a platform_alt.h file. These new functions are required in\n     some embedded environments to provide a means of initialising underlying\n     cryptographic acceleration hardware.\n\nAPI Changes\n   * Reverted API/ABI breaking changes introduced in mbed TLS 2.5.1, to make the\n     API consistent with mbed TLS 2.5.0. Specifically removed the inline\n     qualifier from the functions mbedtls_aes_decrypt, mbedtls_aes_encrypt,\n     mbedtls_ssl_ciphersuite_uses_ec and mbedtls_ssl_ciphersuite_uses_psk. Found\n     by James Cowgill. #978\n   * Certificate verification functions now set flags to -1 in case the full\n     chain was not verified due to an internal error (including in the verify\n     callback) or chain length limitations.\n   * With authmode set to optional, the TLS handshake is now aborted if the\n     verification of the peer's certificate failed due to an overlong chain or\n     a fatal error in the verify callback.\n\nBugfix\n   * Add a check if iv_len is zero in GCM, and return an error if it is zero.\n     Reported by roberto. #716\n   * Replace preprocessor condition from #if defined(MBEDTLS_THREADING_PTHREAD)\n     to #if defined(MBEDTLS_THREADING_C) as the library cannot assume they will\n     always be implemented by pthread support. #696\n   * Fix a resource leak on Windows platforms in mbedtls_x509_crt_parse_path(),\n     in the case of an error.

Found by wairua. #666\n   * Avoid shadowing of time and index functions through mbed TLS function\n     arguments. Found by inestlerode. #557.\n\nChanges\n   * Added config.h option MBEDTLS_NO_UDBL_DIVISION, to prevent the use of\n     64-bit division. This is useful on embedded platforms where 64-bit division\n     created a dependency on external libraries. #708\n   * Removed mutexes from ECP hardware accelerator code. Now all hardware\n     accelerator code in the library leaves concurrency handling to the\n     platform. Reported by Steven Cooreman. #863\n   * Define the macro MBEDTLS_AES_ROM_TABLES in the configuration file\n     config-no-entropy.h to reduce the RAM footprint.\n   * Added a test script that can be hooked into git that verifies commits\n     before they are pushed.\n   * Improve documentation of PKCS1 decryption functions.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.5.1 released 2017-06-21\n\nSecurity\n   * Fixed unlimited overread of heap-based buffer in mbedtls_ssl_read().\n     The issue could only happen client-side with renegotiation enabled.\n     Could result in DoS (application crash) or information leak\n     (if the application layer sent data read from mbedtls_ssl_read()\n     back to the server or to a third party). Can be triggered remotely.\n   * Removed SHA-1 and RIPEMD-160 from the default hash algorithms for\n     certificate verification.

Reported by Hugo Leisink. #810\n   * Tighten parsing of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures, to avoid a\n     potential Bleichenbacher/BERserk-style attack.\n\nBugfix\n   * Remove size zero arrays from ECJPAKE test suite. Size zero arrays are not\n     valid C and they prevented the test from compiling in Visual Studio 2015\n     and with GCC using the -Wpedantic compilation option.\n   * Fix insufficient support for signature-hash-algorithm extension,\n     resulting in compatibility problems with Chrome. Found by hfloyrd. #823\n   * Fix behaviour that hid the original cause of fatal alerts in some cases\n     when sending the alert failed. The fix makes sure not to hide the error\n     that triggered the alert.\n   * Fix SSLv3 renegotiation behaviour and stop processing data received from\n     peer after sending a fatal alert to refuse a renegotiation attempt.\n     Previous behaviour was to keep processing data even after the alert has\n     been sent.\n   * Accept empty trusted CA chain in authentication mode\n     MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_OPTIONAL.\n     Found by jethrogb. #864\n   * Fix implementation of mbedtls_ssl_parse_certificate() to not annihilate\n     fatal errors in authentication mode MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_OPTIONAL and to\n     reflect bad EC curves within verification result.\n   * Fix bug that caused the modular inversion function to accept the invalid\n     modulus 1 and therefore to hang.

Full list of renamings in scripts/data_files/rename-1.3-2.0.txt\n   * Renamings of fields inside structures, not covered by the previous list:\n     mbedtls_cipher_info_t.key_length -> key_bitlen\n     mbedtls_cipher_context_t.key_length -> key_bitlen\n     mbedtls_ecp_curve_info.size -> bit_size\n   * Headers are now found in the 'mbedtls' directory (previously 'polarssl').\n   * The following _init() functions that could return errors have\n     been split into an _init() that returns void and another function that\n     should generally be the first function called on this context after init:\n     mbedtls_ssl_init() -> mbedtls_ssl_setup()\n     mbedtls_ccm_init() -> mbedtls_ccm_setkey()\n     mbedtls_gcm_init() -> mbedtls_gcm_setkey()\n     mbedtls_hmac_drbg_init() -> mbedtls_hmac_drbg_seed(_buf)()\n     mbedtls_ctr_drbg_init()  -> mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed()\n     Note that for mbedtls_ssl_setup(), you need to be done setting up the\n     ssl_config structure before calling it.\n   * Most ssl_set_xxx() functions (all except ssl_set_bio(), ssl_set_hostname(),\n     ssl_set_session() and ssl_set_client_transport_id(), plus\n     ssl_legacy_renegotiation()) have been renamed to mbedtls_ssl_conf_xxx()\n     (see rename.pl and compat-1.3.h above) and their first argument's type\n     changed from ssl_context to ssl_config.\n   * ssl_set_bio() changed signature (contexts merged, order switched, one\n     additional callback for read-with-timeout).\n   * The following functions have been introduced and must be used in callback\n     implementations (SNI, PSK) instead of their *conf counterparts:\n     mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_own_cert()\n     mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_ca_chain()\n     mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_psk()\n   * mbedtls_ssl_conf_ca_chain() lost its last argument (peer_cn), now set\n     using mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname().\n   * mbedtls_ssl_conf_session_cache() changed prototype (only one context\n     pointer, parameters reordered).\n   * On server, mbedtls_ssl_conf_session_tickets_cb() must now be used in\n     place of mbedtls_ssl_conf_session_tickets() to enable session tickets.\n   * The SSL debug callback gained two new arguments (file name, line number).\n   * Debug modes were removed.\n   * mbedtls_ssl_conf_truncated_hmac() now returns void.\n   * mbedtls_memory_buffer_alloc_init() now returns void.\n   * X.509 verification flags are now an uint32_t. Affect the signature of:\n     mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result()\n     mbedtls_x509_ctr_verify_info()\n     mbedtls_x509_crt_verify() (flags, f_vrfy -> needs to be updated)\n     mbedtls_ssl_conf_verify() (f_vrfy -> needs to be updated)\n   * The following functions changed prototype to avoid an in-out length\n     parameter:\n     mbedtls_base64_encode()\n     mbedtls_base64_decode()\n     mbedtls_mpi_write_string()\n     mbedtls_dhm_calc_secret()\n   * In the NET module, all \"int\" and \"int *\" arguments for file descriptors\n     changed type to \"mbedtls_net_context *\".\n   * net_accept() gained new arguments for the size of the client_ip buffer.\n   * In the threading layer, mbedtls_mutex_init() and mbedtls_mutex_free() now\n     return void.\n   * ecdsa_write_signature() gained an additional md_alg argument and\n     ecdsa_write_signature_det() was deprecated.\n   * pk_sign() no longer accepts md_alg == POLARSSL_MD_NONE with ECDSA.\n   * Last argument of x509_crt_check_key_usage() and\n     mbedtls_x509write_crt_set_key_usage() changed from int to unsigned.\n   * test_ca_list (from certs.h) is renamed to test_cas_pem and is only\n     available if POLARSSL_PEM_PARSE_C is defined (it never worked without).\n   * Test certificates in certs.c are no longer guaranteed to be nul-terminated\n     strings; use the new *_len variables instead of strlen().\n   * Functions mbedtls_x509_xxx_parse(), mbedtls_pk_parse_key(),\n     mbedtls_pk_parse_public_key() and mbedtls_dhm_parse_dhm() now expect the\n     length parameter to include the terminating null byte for PEM input.\n   * Signature of mpi_mul_mpi() changed to make the last argument unsigned\n   * calloc() is now used instead of malloc() everywhere. API of platform\n     layer and the memory_buffer_alloc module changed accordingly.\n     (Thanks to Mansour Moufid for helping with the replacement.)\n   * Change SSL_DISABLE_RENEGOTIATION config.h flag to SSL_RENEGOTIATION\n     (support for renegotiation now needs explicit enabling in config.h).\n   * Split MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME into MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME and MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE\n     in config.h\n   * net_connect() and net_bind() have a new 'proto' argument to choose\n     between TCP and UDP, using the macros NET_PROTO_TCP or NET_PROTO_UDP.\n     Their 'port' argument type is changed to a string.\n   * Some constness fixes\n\nRemovals\n   * Removed mbedtls_ecp_group_read_string(). Only named groups are supported.\n   * Removed mbedtls_ecp_sub() and mbedtls_ecp_add(), use\n     mbedtls_ecp_muladd().\n   * Removed individual mdX_hmac, shaX_hmac, mdX_file and shaX_file functions\n     (use generic functions from md.h)\n   * Removed mbedtls_timing_msleep().

Those headers are\n     not supposed to be included by users.\n   * Changed md_info_t into an opaque structure (use md_get_xxx() accessors).\n   * Changed pk_info_t into an opaque structure.\n   * Changed cipher_base_t into an opaque structure.\n   * Removed sig_oid2 and rename sig_oid1 to sig_oid in x509_crt and x509_crl.\n   * x509_crt.key_usage changed from unsigned char to unsigned int.\n   * Removed r and s from ecdsa_context\n   * Removed mode from des_context and des3_context\n\nDefault behavior changes\n   * The default minimum TLS version is now TLS 1.0.\n   * RC4 is now blacklisted by default in the SSL/TLS layer, and excluded from the\n     default ciphersuite list returned by ssl_list_ciphersuites()\n   * Support for receiving SSLv2 ClientHello is now disabled by default at\n     compile time.\n   * The default authmode for SSL/TLS clients is now REQUIRED.\n   * Support for RSA_ALT contexts in the PK layer is now optional. Since is is\n     enabled in the default configuration, this is only noticeable if using a\n     custom config.h\n   * Default DHM parameters server-side upgraded from 1024 to 2048 bits.\n   * A minimum RSA key size of 2048 bits is now enforced during ceritificate\n     chain verification.\n   * Negotiation of truncated HMAC is now disabled by default on server too.\n   * The following functions are now case-sensitive:\n     mbedtls_cipher_info_from_string()\n     mbedtls_ecp_curve_info_from_name()\n     mbedtls_md_info_from_string()\n     mbedtls_ssl_ciphersuite_from_string()\n     mbedtls_version_check_feature()\n\nRequirement changes\n   * The minimum MSVC version required is now 2010 (better C99 support).\n   * The NET layer now unconditionnaly relies on getaddrinfo() and select().\n   * Compiler is required to support C99 types such as long long and uint32_t.\n\nAPI changes from the 1.4 preview branch\n   * ssl_set_bio_timeout() was removed, split into mbedtls_ssl_set_bio() with\n     new prototype, and mbedtls_ssl_set_read_timeout().\n   * The following functions now return void:\n     mbedtls_ssl_conf_transport()\n     mbedtls_ssl_conf_max_version()\n     mbedtls_ssl_conf_min_version()\n   * DTLS no longer hard-depends on TIMING_C, but uses a callback interface\n     instead, see mbedtls_ssl_set_timer_cb(), with the Timing module providing\n     an example implementation, see mbedtls_timing_delay_context and\n     mbedtls_timing_set/get_delay().\n   * With UDP sockets, it is no longer necessary to call net_bind() again\n     after a successful net_accept().\n\nChanges\n   * mbedtls_ctr_drbg_random() and mbedtls_hmac_drbg_random() are now\n     thread-safe if MBEDTLS_THREADING_C is enabled.\n   * Reduced ROM fooprint of SHA-256 and added an option to reduce it even\n     more (at the expense of performance) MBEDTLS_SHA256_SMALLER.\n\n= mbed TLS 1.3 branch\n\nSecurity\n   * With authmode set to SSL_VERIFY_OPTIONAL, verification of keyUsage and\n     extendedKeyUsage on the leaf certificate was lost (results not accessible\n     via ssl_get_verify_results()).\n   * Add countermeasure against \"Lucky 13 strikes back\" cache-based attack,\n     https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2714625\n\nFeatures\n   * Improve ECC performance by using more efficient doubling formulas\n     (contributed by

(except on Windows) and exit() in\n     the platform layer.\n   * Add an option to use macros instead of function pointers in the platform\n     layer (helps get rid of unwanted references).\n   * Improved Makefiles for Windows targets by fixing library targets and making\n     cross-compilation easier (thanks to Alon Bar-Lev).\n   * The benchmark program also prints heap usage for public-key primitives\n     if POLARSSL_MEMORY_BUFFER_ALLOC_C and POLARSSL_MEMORY_DEBUG are defined.\n   * New script ecc-heap.sh helps measuring the impact of ECC parameters on\n     speed and RAM (heap only for now) usage.\n   * New script memory.sh helps measuring the ROM and RAM requirements of two\n     reduced configurations (PSK-CCM and NSA suite B).\n   * Add config flag POLARSSL_DEPRECATED_WARNING (off by default) to produce\n     warnings on use of deprecated functions (with GCC and Clang only).\n   * Add config flag POLARSSL_DEPRECATED_REMOVED (off by default) to produce\n     errors on use of deprecated functions.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix compile errors with PLATFORM_NO_STD_FUNCTIONS.\n   * Fix compile error with PLATFORM_EXIT_ALT (thanks to Rafa\u0142 Przywara).\n   * Fix bug in entropy.c

aesni.h (reported by amir zamani).\n   * Add missing dependency on SHA-256 in some x509 programs (reported by\n     Gergely Budai).\n   * Fix bug related to ssl_set_curves(): the client didn't check that the\n     curve picked by the server was actually allowed.\n\nChanges\n   * Remove bias in mpi_gen_prime (contributed by Pascal Junod).\n   * Remove potential sources of timing variations (some contributed by Pascal\n     Junod).\n   * Options POLARSSL_HAVE_INT8 and POLARSSL_HAVE_INT16 are deprecated.\n   * Enabling POLARSSL_NET_C without POLARSSL_HAVE_IPV6 is deprecated.\n   * compat-1.2.h and openssl.h are deprecated.\n   * Adjusting/overriding CFLAGS and LDFLAGS with the make build system is now\n     more flexible (warning: OFLAGS is not used any more) (see the README)\n     (contributed by Alon Bar-Lev).\n   * ssl_set_own_cert() no longer calls pk_check_pair() since the\n     performance impact was bad for some users (this was introduced in 1.3.10).\n   * Move from SHA-1 to SHA-256 in example programs using signatures\n     (suggested by Thorsten M\u00fchlfelder).\n   * Remove some unneeded inclusions of header files from the standard library\n     \"minimize\" others

aborted due\n     to a failed verification (found by Fredrik Axelsson).\n   * Skip writing and parsing signature_algorithm extension if none of the\n     key exchanges enabled needs certificates. This fixes a possible interop\n     issue with some servers when a zero-length extension was sent. (Reported\n     by Peter Dettman.)\n   * On a 0-length input, base64_encode() did not correctly set output length\n     (found by Hendrik van den Boogaard).\n\nChanges\n   * Use deterministic nonces

"fixing_code": ["mbed TLS ChangeLog (Sorted per branch, date)\n\n= mbed TLS x.x.x branch released xxxx-xx-xx\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix a missing error detection in ECJPAKE. This could have caused a\n     predictable shared secret if a hardware accelerator failed and the other\n     side of the key exchange had a similar bug.\n   * The deterministic ECDSA calculation reused the scheme's HMAC-DRBG to\n     implement blinding. Because of this for the same key and message the same\n     blinding value was generated. This reduced the effectiveness of the\n     countermeasure and leaked information about the private key through side\n     channels. Reported by Jack Lloyd.\n\nAPI Changes\n   * The new function mbedtls_ecdsa_sign_det_ext() is similar to\n     mbedtls_ecdsa_sign_det() but allows passing an external RNG for the\n     purpose of blinding.\n   * The new function mbedtls_ecp_gen_privkey() allows to generate a private\n     key without generating the public part of the pair.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix to allow building test suites with any warning that detects unused\n     functions. Fixes #1628.\n   * Fix typo in net_would_block(). Fixes #528 reported by github-monoculture.\n   * Remove redundant include file in timing.c. Fixes #2640 reported by irwir.\n   * Fix Visual Studio Release x64 build configuration by inheriting\n     PlatformToolset from the project configuration. Fixes #1430 reported by\n     irwir.\n   * Enable Suite B with subset of ECP curves. Make sure the code compiles even\n     if some curves are not defined. Fixes #1591 reported by dbedev.\n   * Fix misuse of signed arithmetic in the HAVEGE module. #2598\n\nChanges\n   * Make `make clean` clean all programs always. Fixes #1862.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.11 branch released 2019-06-11\n\nSecurity\n   * Make mbedtls_ecdh_get_params return an error if the second key\n     belongs to a different group from the first. Before, if an application\n     passed keys that belonged to different group, the first key's data was\n     interpreted according to the second group, which could lead to either\n     an error or a meaningless output from mbedtls_ecdh_get_params. In the\n     latter case, this could expose at most 5 bits of the private key.\n\nBugfix\n   * Server's RSA certificate in certs.c was SHA-1 signed. In the default\n     mbedTLS configuration only SHA-2 signed certificates are accepted.\n     This certificate is used in the demo server programs, which lead the\n     client programs to fail at the peer's certificate verification\n     due to an unacceptable hash signature. The certificate has been\n     updated to one that is SHA-256 signed. Fix contributed by\n     Illya Gerasymchuk.\n   * Fix private key DER output in the key_app_writer example.

Found and fixed by\n     Junhwan Park, #2106.\n   * Fix 1-byte buffer overflow in mbedtls_mpi_write_string() when\n     used with negative inputs. Found by Guido Vranken in #2404. Credit to\n     OSS-Fuzz.\n   * Fix bugs in the AEAD test suite which would be exposed by ciphers which\n     either used both encrypt and decrypt key schedules, or which perform padding.\n     GCM and CCM were not affected. Fixed by Jack Lloyd.\n   * Fix incorrect default port number in ssl_mail_client example's usage.\n     Found and fixed by irwir. #2337\n   * Add missing parentheses around parameters in the definition of the\n     public macro MBEDTLS_X509_ID_FLAG. This could lead to invalid evaluation\n     in case operators binding less strongly than subtraction were used\n     for the parameter.\n   * Add a check for MBEDTLS_X509_CRL_PARSE_C in ssl_server2, guarding the crl\n     sni entry parameter. Reported by inestlerode in #560.\n   * Fix missing bounds checks in X.509 parsing functions that could\n     lead to successful parsing of ill-formed X.509 CRTs.

Fixes #1610.\n\nChanges\n   * Include configuration file in all header files that use configuration,\n     instead of relying on other header files that they include.\n     Inserted as an enhancement for #1371\n   * Add support for alternative CSR headers, as used by Microsoft and defined\n     in RFC 7468. Found by Michael Ernst. Fixes #767.\n   * Fix clobber list in MIPS assembly for large integer multiplication.\n     Previously, this could lead to functionally incorrect assembly being\n     produced by some optimizing compilers, showing up as failures in\n     e.g. RSA or ECC signature operations. Reported in #1722, fix suggested\n     by Aurelien Jarno and submitted by Jeffrey Martin.\n   * Reduce the complexity of the timing tests. They were assuming more than the\n     underlying OS actually guarantees.\n   * Ciphersuites based on 3DES now have the lowest priority by default when\n     they are enabled.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.9 branch released 2018-12-21\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix for Clang, which was reporting a warning for the bignum.c inline\n     assembly for AMD64 targets creating string literals greater than those\n     permitted by the ISO C99 standard. Found by Aaron Jones. Fixes #482.\n   * Fix runtime error in `mbedtls_platform_entropy_poll()` when run\n     through qemu user emulation. Reported and fix suggested by randombit\n     in #1212. Fixes #1212.\n   * Fix an unsafe bounds check when restoring an SSL session from a ticket.\n     This could lead to a buffer overflow, but only in case ticket authentication\n     was broken. Reported and fix suggested by Guido Vranken in #659.\n   * Add explicit integer to enumeration type casts to example program\n     programs/pkey/gen_key which previously led to compilation failure\n     on some toolchains. Reported by phoenixmcallister. Fixes #2170.\n   * Clarify documentation of mbedtls_ssl_set_own_cert() regarding the absence\n     of check for certificate/key matching. Reported by Attila Molnar, #507.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.8 branch released 2018-11-30\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix timing variations and memory access variations in RSA PKCS#1 v1.5\n     decryption that could lead to a Bleichenbacher-style padding oracle\n     attack. In TLS, this affects servers that accept ciphersuites based on\n     RSA decryption (i.e. ciphersuites whose name contains RSA but not\n     (EC)DH(E)). Discovered by Eyal Ronen (Weizmann Institute),  Robert Gillham\n     (University of Adelaide), Daniel Genkin (University of Michigan),\n     Adi Shamir (Weizmann Institute), David Wong (NCC Group), and Yuval Yarom\n     (University of Adelaide, Data61). The attack is described in more detail\n     in the paper available here: http://cat.eyalro.net/cat.pdf  CVE-2018-19608\n   * In mbedtls_mpi_write_binary(), don't leak the exact size of the number\n     via branching and memory access patterns. An attacker who could submit\n     a plaintext for RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption but only observe the timing\n     of the decryption and not its result could nonetheless decrypt RSA\n     plaintexts and forge RSA signatures. Other asymmetric algorithms may\n     have been similarly vulnerable. Reported by Eyal Ronen, Robert Gillham,\n     Daniel Genkin, Adi Shamir, David Wong and Yuval Yarom.\n   * Wipe sensitive buffers on the stack in the CTR_DRBG and HMAC_DRBG\n     modules.\n\nAPI Changes\n   * The new functions mbedtls_ctr_drbg_update_ret() and\n     mbedtls_hmac_drbg_update_ret() are similar to mbedtls_ctr_drbg_update()\n     and mbedtls_hmac_drbg_update() respectively, but the new functions\n     report errors whereas the old functions return void. We recommend that\n     applications use the new functions.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.7 branch released 2018-11-19\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix overly strict DN comparison when looking for CRLs belonging to a\n     particular CA. This previously led to ignoring CRLs when the CRL's issuer\n     name and the CA's subject name differed in their string encoding (e.g.,\n     one using PrintableString and the other UTF8String) or in the choice of\n     upper and lower case. Reported by Henrik Andersson of Bosch GmbH in issue\n     #1784.\n   * Fix a flawed bounds check in server PSK hint parsing. In case the\n     incoming message buffer was placed within the first 64KiB of address\n     space and a PSK-(EC)DHE ciphersuite was used, this allowed an attacker\n     to trigger a memory access up to 64KiB beyond the incoming message buffer,\n     potentially leading to application crash or information disclosure.\n   * Fix mbedtls_mpi_is_prime() to use more rounds of probabilistic testing. The\n     previous settings for the number of rounds made it practical for an\n     adversary to construct non-primes that would be erroneously accepted as\n     primes with high probability. This does not have an impact on the\n     security of TLS, but can matter in other contexts with numbers chosen\n     potentially by an adversary that should be prime and can be validated.\n     For example, the number of rounds was enough to securely generate RSA key\n     pairs or Diffie-Hellman parameters, but was insufficient to validate\n     Diffie-Hellman parameters properly.\n     See \"Prime and Prejudice\" by by Martin R. Albrecht and Jake Massimo and\n     Kenneth G. Paterson and Juraj Somorovsky.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix failure in hmac_drbg in the benchmark sample application, when\n     MBEDTLS_THREADING_C is defined. Found by TrinityTonic, #1095\n   * Fix a bug in the update function for SSL ticket keys which previously\n     invalidated keys of a lifetime of less than a 1s. Fixes #1968.\n   * Fix a bug in the record decryption routine ssl_decrypt_buf()\n     which led to accepting properly authenticated but improperly\n     padded records in case of CBC ciphersuites using Encrypt-then-MAC.\n   * Fix wrong order of freeing in programs/ssl/ssl_server2 example\n     application leading to a memory leak in case both\n     MBEDTLS_MEMORY_BUFFER_ALLOC_C and MBEDTLS_MEMORY_BACKTRACE are set.\n     Fixes #2069.\n   * Fix memory leak and freeing without initialization in the example\n     program programs/x509/cert_write. Fixes #1422.\n   * Ignore IV in mbedtls_cipher_set_iv() when the cipher mode is\n     MBEDTLS_MODE_ECB. Found by ezdevelop. Fixes for #1091.\n   * Zeroize memory used for reassembling handshake messages after use.\n   * Use `mbedtls_zeroize()` instead of `memset()` for zeroization of\n     sensitive data in the example programs aescrypt2 and crypt_and_hash.\n   * Fix compilation failure for configurations which use compile time\n     replacements of standard calloc/free functions through the macros\n     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_CALLOC_MACRO and MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_FREE_MACRO.\n     Reported by ole-de and ddhome2006. Fixes #882, #1642 and #1706.\n\nChanges\n   * Add tests for session resumption in DTLS.\n   * Close a test gap in (D)TLS between the client side and the server side:\n     test the handling of large packets and small packets on the client side\n     in the same way as on the server side.\n   * Change the dtls_client and dtls_server samples to work by default over\n     IPv6 and optionally by a build option over IPv4.\n   * Change the use of Windows threading to use Microsoft Visual C++ runtime\n     calls, rather than Win32 API calls directly. This is necessary to avoid\n     conflict with C runtime usage. Found and fixed by irwir.\n   * Improve documentation of mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result().\n     Fixes #517 reported by github-monoculture.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.6 branch released 2018-08-31\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix an issue in the X.509 module which could lead to a buffer overread\n     during certificate extensions parsing. In case of receiving malformed\n     input (extensions length field equal to 0), an illegal read of one byte\n     beyond the input buffer is made. Found and analyzed by Nathan Crandall.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix a potential memory leak in mbedtls_ssl_setup() function. An allocation\n     failure in the function could lead to other buffers being leaked.\n   * Fixes a missing test dependency on MBEDTLS_ARC4_C. #1890\n   * Fix a memory leak in ecp_mul_comb() if ecp_precompute_comb() fails.\n     Fix contributed by Espressif Systems.\n   * Add ecc extensions only if an ecc based ciphersuite is used.\n     This improves compliance to RFC 4492, and as a result, solves\n     interoperability issues with BouncyCastle. Raised by milenamil in #1157.\n   * Fix potential use-after-free in mbedtls_ssl_get_max_frag_len()\n     and mbedtls_ssl_get_record_expansion() after a session reset. Fixes #1941.\n   * Fix a miscalculation of the maximum record expansion in\n     mbedtls_ssl_get_record_expansion() in case of CBC ciphersuites\n     in (D)TLS versions 1.1 or higher. Fixes #1914.\n   * Fix a bug that caused SSL/TLS clients to incorrectly abort the handshake\n     with TLS versions 1.1 and earlier when the server requested authentication\n     without providing a list of CAs. This was due to an overly strict bounds\n     check in parsing the CertificateRequest message, introduced in\n     Mbed TLS 2.12.0. Fixes #1954.\n   * Fix undefined shifts with negative values in certificates parsing\n     (found by Catena cyber using oss-fuzz)\n   * Fix memory leak and free without initialization in pk_encrypt\n     and pk_decrypt example programs. Reported by Brace Stout. Fixes #1128.\n\nChanges\n   * Improve compatibility with some alternative CCM implementations by using\n     CCM test vectors from RAM.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.5 branch released 2018-07-25\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix a vulnerability in TLS ciphersuites based on CBC and using SHA-384,\n     in (D)TLS 1.0 to 1.2, that allowed an active network attacker to\n     partially recover the plaintext of messages under some conditions by\n     exploiting timing measurements. With DTLS, the attacker could perform\n     this recovery by sending many messages in the same connection. With TLS\n     or if mbedtls_ssl_conf_dtls_badmac_limit() was used, the attack only\n     worked if the same secret (for example a HTTP Cookie) has been repeatedly\n     sent over connections manipulated by the attacker. Connections using GCM\n     or CCM instead of CBC, using hash sizes other than SHA-384, or using\n     Encrypt-then-Mac (RFC 7366) were not affected. The vulnerability was\n     caused by a miscalculation (for SHA-384) in a countermeasure to the\n     original Lucky 13 attack. Found by Kenny Paterson, Eyal Ronen and Adi\n     Shamir.\n   * Fix a vulnerability in TLS ciphersuites based on CBC, in (D)TLS 1.0 to\n     1.2, that allowed a local attacker, able to execute code on the local\n     machine as well as manipulate network packets, to partially recover the\n     plaintext of messages under some conditions by using a cache attack\n     targeting an internal MD/SHA buffer. With TLS or if\n     mbedtls_ssl_conf_dtls_badmac_limit() was used, the attack only worked if\n     the same secret (for example a HTTP Cookie) has been repeatedly sent over\n     connections manipulated by the attacker. Connections using GCM or CCM\n     instead of CBC or using Encrypt-then-Mac (RFC 7366) were not affected.\n     Found by Kenny Paterson, Eyal Ronen and Adi Shamir.\n   * Add a counter-measure against a vulnerability in TLS ciphersuites based\n     on CBC, in (D)TLS 1.0 to 1.2, that allowed a local attacker, able to\n     execute code on the local machine as well as manipulate network packets,\n     to partially recover the plaintext of messages under some conditions (see\n     previous entry) by using a cache attack targeting the SSL input record\n     buffer.

Found by TrinityTonic in #1719.\n   * Added length checks to some TLS parsing functions. Found and fixed by\n     Philippe Antoine from Catena cyber. #1663.\n   * Fix namespacing in header files. Remove the `mbedtls` namespacing in\n     the `#include` in the header files. Resolves #857\n   * Fix compiler warning of 'use before initialisation' in\n     mbedtls_pk_parse_key(). Found by Martin Boye Petersen and fixed by Dawid\n     Drozd. #1098\n   * Fix decryption for zero length messages (which contain all padding) when a\n     CBC based ciphersuite is used together with Encrypt-then-MAC. Previously,\n     such a message was wrongly reported as an invalid record and therefore lead\n     to the connection being terminated. Seen most often with OpenSSL using\n     TLS 1.0. Reported by @kFYatek and by Conor Murphy on the forum. Fix\n     contributed by Espressif Systems. Fixes #1632\n   * Fix ssl_client2 example to send application data with 0-length content\n     when the request_size argument is set to 0 as stated in the documentation.\n     Fixes #1833.\n   * Correct the documentation for `mbedtls_ssl_get_session()`.

Additionally, the issue could also lead to\n     unnecessary callback checks being made or to some validation checks to be\n     omitted. The overread could be triggered remotely, while the other issues\n     would require a non DER-compliant certificate to be correctly signed by a\n     trusted CA, or a trusted CA with a non DER-compliant certificate. Found by\n     luocm. Fixes #825.\n   * Fix the buffer length assertion in the ssl_parse_certificate_request()\n     function which led to an arbitrary overread of the message buffer. The\n     overreads could be caused by receiving a malformed message at the point\n     where an optional signature algorithms list is expected when the signature\n     algorithms section is too short. In builds with debug output, the overread\n     data is output with the debug data.\n   * Fix a client-side bug in the validation of the server's ciphersuite choice\n     which could potentially lead to the client accepting a ciphersuite it didn't\n     offer or a ciphersuite that cannot be used with the TLS or DTLS version\n     chosen by the server. This could lead to corruption of internal data\n     structures for some configurations.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix a spurious uninitialized variable warning in cmac.c.

This means\n     that when both sides of a TLS connection negotiate the truncated\n     HMAC extension, Mbed TLS can now interoperate with other\n     compliant implementations, but this breaks interoperability with\n     prior versions of Mbed TLS. To restore the old behavior, enable\n     the (deprecated) option MBEDTLS_SSL_TRUNCATED_HMAC_COMPAT in\n     config.h. Found by Andreas Walz (ivESK, Offenburg University of\n     Applied Sciences).\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix implementation of the truncated HMAC extension. The previous\n     implementation allowed an offline 2^80 brute force attack on the\n     HMAC key of a single, uninterrupted connection (with no\n     resumption of the session).\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix the name of a DHE parameter that was accidentally changed in 2.7.0.\n     Fixes #1358.\n   * Fix test_suite_pk to work on 64-bit ILP32 systems. #849\n   * Fix mbedtls_x509_crt_profile_suiteb, which used to reject all certificates\n     with flag MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_BAD_PK even when the key type was correct.\n     In the context of SSL, this resulted in handshake failure. Reported by\n     daniel in the Mbed TLS forum. #1351\n   * Fix Windows x64 builds with the included mbedTLS.sln file. #1347\n\nChanges\n   * Fix tag lengths and value ranges in the documentation of CCM encryption.\n     Contributed by Mathieu Briand.\n   * Fix typo in a comment ctr_drbg.c. Contributed by Paul Sokolovsky.\n   * MD functions deprecated in 2.7.0 are no longer inline, to provide\n     a migration path for those depending on the library's ABI.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.7.0 branch released 2018-02-03\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix a heap corruption issue in the implementation of the truncated HMAC\n     extension. When the truncated HMAC extension is enabled and CBC is used,\n     sending a malicious application packet could be used to selectively corrupt\n     6 bytes on the peer's heap, which could potentially lead to crash or remote\n     code execution. The issue could be triggered remotely from either side in\n     both TLS and DTLS. CVE-2018-0488\n   * Fix a buffer overflow in RSA-PSS verification when the hash was too large\n     for the key size, which could potentially lead to crash or remote code\n     execution. Found by Seth Terashima, Qualcomm Product Security Initiative,\n     Qualcomm Technologies Inc. CVE-2018-0487\n   * Fix buffer overflow in RSA-PSS verification when the unmasked data is all\n     zeros.\n   * Fix an unsafe bounds check in ssl_parse_client_psk_identity() when adding\n     64 KiB to the address of the SSL buffer and causing a wrap around.\n   * Fix a potential heap buffer overflow in mbedtls_ssl_write(). When the (by\n     default enabled) maximum fragment length extension is disabled in the\n     config and the application data buffer passed to mbedtls_ssl_write\n     is larger than the internal message buffer (16384 bytes by default), the\n     latter overflows. The exploitability of this issue depends on whether the\n     application layer can be forced into sending such large packets. The issue\n     was independently reported by Tim Nordell via e-mail and by Florin Petriuc\n     and sjorsdewit on GitHub. Fix proposed by Florin Petriuc in #1022.\n     Fixes #707.\n   * Add a provision to prevent compiler optimizations breaking the time\n     constancy of mbedtls_ssl_safer_memcmp().\n   * Ensure that buffers are cleared after use if they contain sensitive data.\n     Changes were introduced in multiple places in the library.\n   * Set PEM buffer to zero before freeing it, to avoid decoded private keys\n     being leaked to memory after release.\n   * Fix dhm_check_range() failing to detect trivial subgroups and potentially\n     leaking 1 bit of the private key. Reported by prashantkspatil.\n   * Make mbedtls_mpi_read_binary() constant-time with respect to the input\n     data. Previously, trailing zero bytes were detected and omitted for the\n     sake of saving memory, but potentially leading to slight timing\n     differences. Reported by Marco Macchetti, Kudelski Group.\n   * Wipe stack buffer temporarily holding EC private exponent\n     after keypair generation.\n   * Fix a potential heap buffer over-read in ALPN extension parsing\n     (server-side). Could result in application crash, but only if an ALPN\n     name larger than 16 bytes had been configured on the server.\n   * Change default choice of DHE parameters from untrustworthy RFC 5114\n     to RFC 3526 containing parameters generated in a nothing-up-my-sleeve\n     manner.\n\nFeatures\n   * Allow comments in test data files.\n   * The selftest program can execute a subset of the tests based on command\n     line arguments.\n   * New unit tests for timing. Improve the self-test to be more robust\n     when run on a heavily-loaded machine.\n   * Add alternative implementation support for CCM and CMAC (MBEDTLS_CCM_ALT,\n     MBEDTLS_CMAC_ALT). Submitted by Steven Cooreman, Silicon Labs.\n   * Add support for alternative implementations of GCM, selected by the\n     configuration flag MBEDTLS_GCM_ALT.\n   * Add support for alternative implementations for ECDSA, controlled by new\n     configuration flags MBEDTLS_ECDSA_SIGN_ALT, MBEDTLS_ECDSA_VERIFY_ALT and\n     MBEDTLS_ECDSDA_GENKEY_AT in config.h.\n     The following functions from the ECDSA module can be replaced\n     with alternative implementation:\n     mbedtls_ecdsa_sign(), mbedtls_ecdsa_verify() and mbedtls_ecdsa_genkey().\n   * Add support for alternative implementation of ECDH, controlled by the\n     new configuration flags MBEDTLS_ECDH_COMPUTE_SHARED_ALT and\n     MBEDTLS_ECDH_GEN_PUBLIC_ALT in config.h.\n     The following functions from the ECDH module can be replaced\n     with an alternative implementation:\n     mbedtls_ecdh_gen_public() and mbedtls_ecdh_compute_shared().\n   * Add support for alternative implementation of ECJPAKE, controlled by\n     the new configuration flag MBEDTLS_ECJPAKE_ALT.\n   * Add mechanism to provide alternative implementation of the DHM module.\n\nAPI Changes\n   * Extend RSA interface by multiple functions allowing structure-\n     independent setup and export of RSA contexts. Most notably,\n     mbedtls_rsa_import() and mbedtls_rsa_complete() are introduced for setting\n     up RSA contexts from partial key material and having them completed to the\n     needs of the implementation automatically. This allows to setup private RSA\n     contexts from keys consisting of N,D,E only, even if P,Q are needed for the\n     purpose or CRT and/or blinding.\n   * The configuration option MBEDTLS_RSA_ALT can be used to define alternative\n     implementations of the RSA interface declared in rsa.h.\n   * The following functions in the message digest modules (MD2, MD4, MD5,\n     SHA1, SHA256, SHA512) have been deprecated and replaced as shown below.\n     The new functions change the return type from void to int to allow\n     returning error codes when using MBEDTLS_<MODULE>_ALT.\n     mbedtls_<MODULE>_starts() -> mbedtls_<MODULE>_starts_ret()\n     mbedtls_<MODULE>_update() -> mbedtls_<MODULE>_update_ret()\n     mbedtls_<MODULE>_finish() -> mbedtls_<MODULE>_finish_ret()\n     mbedtls_<MODULE>_process() -> mbedtls_internal_<MODULE>_process()\n\nNew deprecations\n   * Deprecate usage of RSA primitives with non-matching key-type\n     (e.g. signing with a public key).\n   * Direct manipulation of structure fields of RSA contexts is deprecated.\n     Users are advised to use the extended RSA API instead.\n   * Deprecate usage of message digest functions that return void\n     (mbedtls_<MODULE>_starts, mbedtls_<MODULE>_update,\n     mbedtls_<MODULE>_finish and mbedtls_<MODULE>_process where <MODULE> is\n     any of MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512) in favor of functions\n     that can return an error code.\n   * Deprecate untrustworthy DHE parameters from RFC 5114. Superseded by\n     parameters from RFC 3526 or the newly added parameters from RFC 7919.\n   * Deprecate hex string DHE constants MBEDTLS_DHM_RFC3526_MODP_2048_P etc.\n     Supserseded by binary encoded constants MBEDTLS_DHM_RFC3526_MODP_2048_P_BIN\n     etc.\n   * Deprecate mbedtls_ssl_conf_dh_param() for setting default DHE parameters\n     from hex strings. Superseded by mbedtls_ssl_conf_dh_param_bin()\n     accepting DHM parameters in binary form, matching the new constants.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix ssl_parse_record_header() to silently discard invalid DTLS records\n     as recommended in RFC 6347 Section 4.1.2.7.\n   * Fix memory leak in mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname() when called multiple times.\n     Found by projectgus and jethrogb, #836.\n   * Fix usage help in ssl_server2 example. Found and fixed by Bei Lin.\n   * Parse signature algorithm extension when renegotiating. Previously,\n     renegotiated handshakes would only accept signatures using SHA-1\n     regardless of the peer's preferences, or fail if SHA-1 was disabled.\n   * Fix leap year calculation in x509_date_is_valid() to ensure that invalid\n     dates on leap years with 100 and 400 intervals are handled correctly. Found\n     by Nicholas Wilson. #694\n   * Fix some invalid RSA-PSS signatures with keys of size 8N+1 that were\n     accepted. Generating these signatures required the private key.\n   * Fix out-of-memory problem when parsing 4096-bit PKCS8-encrypted RSA keys.\n     Found independently by Florian in the mbed TLS forum and by Mishamax.\n     #878, #1019.\n   * Fix variable used before assignment compilation warnings with IAR\n     toolchain. Found by gkerrien38.\n   * Fix unchecked return codes from AES, DES and 3DES functions in\n     pem_aes_decrypt(), pem_des_decrypt() and pem_des3_decrypt() respectively.\n     If a call to one of the functions of the cryptographic primitive modules\n     failed, the error may not be noticed by the function\n     mbedtls_pem_read_buffer() causing it to return invalid values. Found by\n     Guido Vranken. #756\n   * Include configuration file in md.h, to fix compilation warnings.\n     Reported by aaronmdjones in #1001\n   * Correct extraction of signature-type from PK instance in X.509 CRT and CSR\n     writing routines that prevented these functions to work with alternative\n     RSA implementations.

Found and fixed by Chris Xue.\n   * Fix programs/pkey/dh_server.c so that it actually works with dh_client.c.\n     Found and fixed by Martijn de Milliano.\n   * Fix an issue in the cipher decryption with the mode\n     MBEDTLS_PADDING_ONE_AND_ZEROS that sometimes accepted invalid padding.\n     Note, this padding mode is not used by the TLS protocol. Found and fixed by\n     Micha Kraus.\n   * Fix the entropy.c module to not call mbedtls_sha256_starts() or\n     mbedtls_sha512_starts() in the mbedtls_entropy_init() function.\n   * Fix the entropy.c module to ensure that mbedtls_sha256_init() or\n     mbedtls_sha512_init() is called before operating on the relevant context\n     structure. Do not assume that zeroizing a context is a correct way to\n     reset it. Found independently by ccli8 on Github.\n   * In mbedtls_entropy_free(), properly free the message digest context.\n   * Fix status handshake status message in programs/ssl/dtls_client.c. Found\n     and fixed by muddog.\n\nChanges\n   * Extend cert_write example program by options to set the certificate version\n     and the message digest. Further, allow enabling/disabling of authority\n     identifier, subject identifier and basic constraints extensions.\n   * Only check for necessary RSA structure fields in `mbedtls_rsa_private`. In\n     particular, don't require P,Q if neither CRT nor blinding are\n     used. Reported and fix proposed independently by satur9nine and sliai\n     on GitHub.\n   * Only run AES-192 self-test if AES-192 is available. Fixes #963.\n   * Tighten the RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code and remove the\n     undeclared dependency of the RSA module on the ASN.1 module.\n   * Update all internal usage of deprecated message digest functions to the\n     new ones with return codes. In particular, this modifies the\n     mbedtls_md_info_t structure. Propagate errors from these functions\n     everywhere except some locations in the ssl_tls.c module.\n   * Improve CTR_DRBG error handling by propagating underlying AES errors.\n   * Add MBEDTLS_ERR_XXX_HW_ACCEL_FAILED error codes for all cryptography\n     modules where the software implementation can be replaced by a hardware\n     implementation.\n   * Add explicit warnings for the use of MD2, MD4, MD5, SHA-1, DES and ARC4\n     throughout the library.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.6.0 branch released 2017-08-10\n\nSecurity\n   * Fix authentication bypass in SSL/TLS: when authmode is set to optional,\n     mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() would incorrectly return 0 when the peer's\n     X.509 certificate chain had more than MBEDTLS_X509_MAX_INTERMEDIATE_CA\n     (default: 8) intermediates, even when it was not trusted. This could be\n     triggered remotely from either side. (With authmode set to 'required'\n     (the default), the handshake was correctly aborted).\n   * Reliably wipe sensitive data after use in the AES example applications\n     programs/aes/aescrypt2 and programs/aes/crypt_and_hash.\n     Found by Laurent Simon.\n\nFeatures\n   * Add the functions mbedtls_platform_setup() and mbedtls_platform_teardown()\n     and the context struct mbedtls_platform_context to perform\n     platform-specific setup and teardown operations. The macro\n     MBEDTLS_PLATFORM_SETUP_TEARDOWN_ALT allows the functions to be overridden\n     by the user in a platform_alt.h file. These new functions are required in\n     some embedded environments to provide a means of initialising underlying\n     cryptographic acceleration hardware.\n\nAPI Changes\n   * Reverted API/ABI breaking changes introduced in mbed TLS 2.5.1, to make the\n     API consistent with mbed TLS 2.5.0. Specifically removed the inline\n     qualifier from the functions mbedtls_aes_decrypt, mbedtls_aes_encrypt,\n     mbedtls_ssl_ciphersuite_uses_ec and mbedtls_ssl_ciphersuite_uses_psk. Found\n     by James Cowgill. #978\n   * Certificate verification functions now set flags to -1 in case the full\n     chain was not verified due to an internal error (including in the verify\n     callback) or chain length limitations.\n   * With authmode set to optional, the TLS handshake is now aborted if the\n     verification of the peer's certificate failed due to an overlong chain or\n     a fatal error in the verify callback.\n\nBugfix\n   * Add a check if iv_len is zero in GCM, and return an error if it is zero.\n     Reported by roberto. #716\n   * Replace preprocessor condition from #if defined(MBEDTLS_THREADING_PTHREAD)\n     to #if defined(MBEDTLS_THREADING_C) as the library cannot assume they will\n     always be implemented by pthread support. #696\n   * Fix a resource leak on Windows platforms in mbedtls_x509_crt_parse_path(),\n     in the case of an error.

The overflow could enable maliciously constructed CRLs\n     to bypass the version verification check. Found by Peng Li/Yueh-Hsun Lin,\n     KNOX Security, Samsung Research America\n   * Fix potential integer overflow in the version verification for DER\n     encoded X.509 CSRs. The overflow could enable maliciously constructed CSRs\n     to bypass the version verification check. Found by Peng Li/Yueh-Hsun Lin,\n     KNOX Security, Samsung Research America\n   * Fix a potential integer overflow in the version verification for DER\n     encoded X.509 certificates. The overflow could enable maliciously\n     constructed certificates to bypass the certificate verification check.\n   * Fix a call to the libc function time() to call the platform abstraction\n     function mbedtls_time() instead. Found by wairua. #666\n   * Avoid shadowing of time and index functions through mbed TLS function\n     arguments. Found by inestlerode. #557.\n\nChanges\n   * Added config.h option MBEDTLS_NO_UDBL_DIVISION, to prevent the use of\n     64-bit division. This is useful on embedded platforms where 64-bit division\n     created a dependency on external libraries. #708\n   * Removed mutexes from ECP hardware accelerator code. Now all hardware\n     accelerator code in the library leaves concurrency handling to the\n     platform. Reported by Steven Cooreman. #863\n   * Define the macro MBEDTLS_AES_ROM_TABLES in the configuration file\n     config-no-entropy.h to reduce the RAM footprint.\n   * Added a test script that can be hooked into git that verifies commits\n     before they are pushed.\n   * Improve documentation of PKCS1 decryption functions.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.5.1 released 2017-06-21\n\nSecurity\n   * Fixed unlimited overread of heap-based buffer in mbedtls_ssl_read().\n     The issue could only happen client-side with renegotiation enabled.\n     Could result in DoS (application crash) or information leak\n     (if the application layer sent data read from mbedtls_ssl_read()\n     back to the server or to a third party). Can be triggered remotely.\n   * Removed SHA-1 and RIPEMD-160 from the default hash algorithms for\n     certificate verification. SHA-1 can be turned back on with a compile-time\n     option if needed.\n   * Fixed offset in FALLBACK_SCSV parsing that caused TLS server to fail to\n     detect it sometimes. Reported by Hugo Leisink. #810\n   * Tighten parsing of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures, to avoid a\n     potential Bleichenbacher/BERserk-style attack.\n\nBugfix\n   * Remove size zero arrays from ECJPAKE test suite. Size zero arrays are not\n     valid C and they prevented the test from compiling in Visual Studio 2015\n     and with GCC using the -Wpedantic compilation option.\n   * Fix insufficient support for signature-hash-algorithm extension,\n     resulting in compatibility problems with Chrome. Found by hfloyrd. #823\n   * Fix behaviour that hid the original cause of fatal alerts in some cases\n     when sending the alert failed. The fix makes sure not to hide the error\n     that triggered the alert.\n   * Fix SSLv3 renegotiation behaviour and stop processing data received from\n     peer after sending a fatal alert to refuse a renegotiation attempt.\n     Previous behaviour was to keep processing data even after the alert has\n     been sent.\n   * Accept empty trusted CA chain in authentication mode\n     MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_OPTIONAL.\n     Found by jethrogb. #864\n   * Fix implementation of mbedtls_ssl_parse_certificate() to not annihilate\n     fatal errors in authentication mode MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_OPTIONAL and to\n     reflect bad EC curves within verification result.\n   * Fix bug that caused the modular inversion function to accept the invalid\n     modulus 1 and therefore to hang.

Found by Guido\n     Vranken.\n   * Fix a numerical underflow leading to stack overflow in mpi_read_file()\n     that was triggered uppon reading an empty line. Found by Guido Vranken.\n\nChanges\n   * Send fatal alerts in more cases. The previous behaviour was to skip\n     sending the fatal alert and just drop the connection.\n   * Clarify ECDSA documentation and improve the sample code to avoid\n     misunderstanding and potentially dangerous use of the API. Pointed out\n     by Jean-Philippe Aumasson.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.5.0 branch released 2017-05-17\n\nSecurity\n   * Wipe stack buffers in RSA private key operations\n     (rsa_rsaes_pkcs1_v15_decrypt(), rsa_rsaes_oaep_decrypt).

The default\n     behaviour has not changed, namely every configured CAs name is included.\n\nAPI Changes\n   * The following functions in the AES module have been deprecated and replaced\n     by the functions shown below. The new functions change the return type from\n     void to int to allow returning error codes when using MBEDTLS_AES_ALT,\n     MBEDTLS_AES_DECRYPT_ALT or MBEDTLS_AES_ENCRYPT_ALT.\n     mbedtls_aes_decrypt() -> mbedtls_internal_aes_decrypt()\n     mbedtls_aes_encrypt() -> mbedtls_internal_aes_encrypt()\n\nBugfix\n   * Remove macros from compat-1.3.h that correspond to deleted items from most\n     recent versions of the library. Found by Kyle Keen.\n   * Fixed issue in the Threading module that prevented mutexes from\n     initialising. Found by sznaider. #667 #843\n   * Add checks in the PK module for the RSA functions on 64-bit systems.\n     The PK and RSA modules use different types for passing hash length and\n     without these checks the type cast could lead to data loss. Found by Guido\n     Vranken.\n\n= mbed TLS 2.4.2 branch released 2017-03-08\n\nSecurity\n   * Add checks to prevent signature forgeries for very large messages while\n     using RSA through the PK module in 64-bit systems. The issue was caused by\n     some data loss when casting a size_t to an unsigned int value in the\n     functions rsa_verify_wrap(), rsa_sign_wrap(), rsa_alt_sign_wrap() and\n     mbedtls_pk_sign(). Found by Jean-Philippe Aumasson.\n   * Fixed potential livelock during the parsing of a CRL in PEM format in\n     mbedtls_x509_crl_parse(). A string containing a CRL followed by trailing\n     characters after the footer could result in the execution of an infinite\n     loop. The issue can be triggered remotely.

Full list of renamings in scripts/data_files/rename-1.3-2.0.txt\n   * Renamings of fields inside structures, not covered by the previous list:\n     mbedtls_cipher_info_t.key_length -> key_bitlen\n     mbedtls_cipher_context_t.key_length -> key_bitlen\n     mbedtls_ecp_curve_info.size -> bit_size\n   * Headers are now found in the 'mbedtls' directory (previously 'polarssl').\n   * The following _init() functions that could return errors have\n     been split into an _init() that returns void and another function that\n     should generally be the first function called on this context after init:\n     mbedtls_ssl_init() -> mbedtls_ssl_setup()\n     mbedtls_ccm_init() -> mbedtls_ccm_setkey()\n     mbedtls_gcm_init() -> mbedtls_gcm_setkey()\n     mbedtls_hmac_drbg_init() -> mbedtls_hmac_drbg_seed(_buf)()\n     mbedtls_ctr_drbg_init()  -> mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed()\n     Note that for mbedtls_ssl_setup(), you need to be done setting up the\n     ssl_config structure before calling it.\n   * Most ssl_set_xxx() functions (all except ssl_set_bio(), ssl_set_hostname(),\n     ssl_set_session() and ssl_set_client_transport_id(), plus\n     ssl_legacy_renegotiation()) have been renamed to mbedtls_ssl_conf_xxx()\n     (see rename.pl and compat-1.3.h above) and their first argument's type\n     changed from ssl_context to ssl_config.\n   * ssl_set_bio() changed signature (contexts merged, order switched, one\n     additional callback for read-with-timeout).\n   * The following functions have been introduced and must be used in callback\n     implementations (SNI, PSK) instead of their *conf counterparts:\n     mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_own_cert()\n     mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_ca_chain()\n     mbedtls_ssl_set_hs_psk()\n   * mbedtls_ssl_conf_ca_chain() lost its last argument (peer_cn), now set\n     using mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname().\n   * mbedtls_ssl_conf_session_cache() changed prototype (only one context\n     pointer, parameters reordered).\n   * On server, mbedtls_ssl_conf_session_tickets_cb() must now be used in\n     place of mbedtls_ssl_conf_session_tickets() to enable session tickets.\n   * The SSL debug callback gained two new arguments (file name, line number).\n   * Debug modes were removed.\n   * mbedtls_ssl_conf_truncated_hmac() now returns void.\n   * mbedtls_memory_buffer_alloc_init() now returns void.\n   * X.509 verification flags are now an uint32_t. Affect the signature of:\n     mbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result()\n     mbedtls_x509_ctr_verify_info()\n     mbedtls_x509_crt_verify() (flags, f_vrfy -> needs to be updated)\n     mbedtls_ssl_conf_verify() (f_vrfy -> needs to be updated)\n   * The following functions changed prototype to avoid an in-out length\n     parameter:\n     mbedtls_base64_encode()\n     mbedtls_base64_decode()\n     mbedtls_mpi_write_string()\n     mbedtls_dhm_calc_secret()\n   * In the NET module, all \"int\" and \"int *\" arguments for file descriptors\n     changed type to \"mbedtls_net_context *\".\n   * net_accept() gained new arguments for the size of the client_ip buffer.\n   * In the threading layer, mbedtls_mutex_init() and mbedtls_mutex_free() now\n     return void.\n   * ecdsa_write_signature() gained an additional md_alg argument and\n     ecdsa_write_signature_det() was deprecated.\n   * pk_sign() no longer accepts md_alg == POLARSSL_MD_NONE with ECDSA.\n   * Last argument of x509_crt_check_key_usage() and\n     mbedtls_x509write_crt_set_key_usage() changed from int to unsigned.\n   * test_ca_list (from certs.h) is renamed to test_cas_pem and is only\n     available if POLARSSL_PEM_PARSE_C is defined (it never worked without).\n   * Test certificates in certs.c are no longer guaranteed to be nul-terminated\n     strings; use the new *_len variables instead of strlen().\n   * Functions mbedtls_x509_xxx_parse(), mbedtls_pk_parse_key(),\n     mbedtls_pk_parse_public_key() and mbedtls_dhm_parse_dhm() now expect the\n     length parameter to include the terminating null byte for PEM input.\n   * Signature of mpi_mul_mpi() changed to make the last argument unsigned\n   * calloc() is now used instead of malloc() everywhere. API of platform\n     layer and the memory_buffer_alloc module changed accordingly.\n     (Thanks to Mansour Moufid for helping with the replacement.)\n   * Change SSL_DISABLE_RENEGOTIATION config.h flag to SSL_RENEGOTIATION\n     (support for renegotiation now needs explicit enabling in config.h).\n   * Split MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME into MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME and MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE\n     in config.h\n   * net_connect() and net_bind() have a new 'proto' argument to choose\n     between TCP and UDP, using the macros NET_PROTO_TCP or NET_PROTO_UDP.\n     Their 'port' argument type is changed to a string.\n   * Some constness fixes\n\nRemovals\n   * Removed mbedtls_ecp_group_read_string(). Only named groups are supported.\n   * Removed mbedtls_ecp_sub() and mbedtls_ecp_add(), use\n     mbedtls_ecp_muladd().\n   * Removed individual mdX_hmac, shaX_hmac, mdX_file and shaX_file functions\n     (use generic functions from md.h)\n   * Removed mbedtls_timing_msleep().

Those headers are\n     not supposed to be included by users.\n   * Changed md_info_t into an opaque structure (use md_get_xxx() accessors).\n   * Changed pk_info_t into an opaque structure.\n   * Changed cipher_base_t into an opaque structure.\n   * Removed sig_oid2 and rename sig_oid1 to sig_oid in x509_crt and x509_crl.\n   * x509_crt.key_usage changed from unsigned char to unsigned int.\n   * Removed r and s from ecdsa_context\n   * Removed mode from des_context and des3_context\n\nDefault behavior changes\n   * The default minimum TLS version is now TLS 1.0.\n   * RC4 is now blacklisted by default in the SSL/TLS layer, and excluded from the\n     default ciphersuite list returned by ssl_list_ciphersuites()\n   * Support for receiving SSLv2 ClientHello is now disabled by default at\n     compile time.\n   * The default authmode for SSL/TLS clients is now REQUIRED.\n   * Support for RSA_ALT contexts in the PK layer is now optional. Since is is\n     enabled in the default configuration, this is only noticeable if using a\n     custom config.h\n   * Default DHM parameters server-side upgraded from 1024 to 2048 bits.\n   * A minimum RSA key size of 2048 bits is now enforced during ceritificate\n     chain verification.\n   * Negotiation of truncated HMAC is now disabled by default on server too.\n   * The following functions are now case-sensitive:\n     mbedtls_cipher_info_from_string()\n     mbedtls_ecp_curve_info_from_name()\n     mbedtls_md_info_from_string()\n     mbedtls_ssl_ciphersuite_from_string()\n     mbedtls_version_check_feature()\n\nRequirement changes\n   * The minimum MSVC version required is now 2010 (better C99 support).\n   * The NET layer now unconditionnaly relies on getaddrinfo() and select().\n   * Compiler is required to support C99 types such as long long and uint32_t.\n\nAPI changes from the 1.4 preview branch\n   * ssl_set_bio_timeout() was removed, split into mbedtls_ssl_set_bio() with\n     new prototype, and mbedtls_ssl_set_read_timeout().\n   * The following functions now return void:\n     mbedtls_ssl_conf_transport()\n     mbedtls_ssl_conf_max_version()\n     mbedtls_ssl_conf_min_version()\n   * DTLS no longer hard-depends on TIMING_C, but uses a callback interface\n     instead, see mbedtls_ssl_set_timer_cb(), with the Timing module providing\n     an example implementation, see mbedtls_timing_delay_context and\n     mbedtls_timing_set/get_delay().\n   * With UDP sockets, it is no longer necessary to call net_bind() again\n     after a successful net_accept().\n\nChanges\n   * mbedtls_ctr_drbg_random() and mbedtls_hmac_drbg_random() are now\n     thread-safe if MBEDTLS_THREADING_C is enabled.\n   * Reduced ROM fooprint of SHA-256 and added an option to reduce it even\n     more (at the expense of performance) MBEDTLS_SHA256_SMALLER.\n\n= mbed TLS 1.3 branch\n\nSecurity\n   * With authmode set to SSL_VERIFY_OPTIONAL, verification of keyUsage and\n     extendedKeyUsage on the leaf certificate was lost (results not accessible\n     via ssl_get_verify_results()).\n   * Add countermeasure against \"Lucky 13 strikes back\" cache-based attack,\n     https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2714625\n\nFeatures\n   * Improve ECC performance by using more efficient doubling formulas\n     (contributed by

(except on Windows) and exit() in\n     the platform layer.\n   * Add an option to use macros instead of function pointers in the platform\n     layer (helps get rid of unwanted references).\n   * Improved Makefiles for Windows targets by fixing library targets and making\n     cross-compilation easier (thanks to Alon Bar-Lev).\n   * The benchmark program also prints heap usage for public-key primitives\n     if POLARSSL_MEMORY_BUFFER_ALLOC_C and POLARSSL_MEMORY_DEBUG are defined.\n   * New script ecc-heap.sh helps measuring the impact of ECC parameters on\n     speed and RAM (heap only for now) usage.\n   * New script memory.sh helps measuring the ROM and RAM requirements of two\n     reduced configurations (PSK-CCM and NSA suite B).\n   * Add config flag POLARSSL_DEPRECATED_WARNING (off by default) to produce\n     warnings on use of deprecated functions (with GCC and Clang only).\n   * Add config flag POLARSSL_DEPRECATED_REMOVED (off by default) to produce\n     errors on use of deprecated functions.\n\nBugfix\n   * Fix compile errors with PLATFORM_NO_STD_FUNCTIONS.\n   * Fix compile error with PLATFORM_EXIT_ALT (thanks to Rafa\u0142 Przywara).\n   * Fix bug in entropy.c

aesni.h (reported by amir zamani).\n   * Add missing dependency on SHA-256 in some x509 programs (reported by\n     Gergely Budai).\n   * Fix bug related to ssl_set_curves(): the client didn't check that the\n     curve picked by the server was actually allowed.\n\nChanges\n   * Remove bias in mpi_gen_prime (contributed by Pascal Junod).\n   * Remove potential sources of timing variations (some contributed by Pascal\n     Junod).\n   * Options POLARSSL_HAVE_INT8 and POLARSSL_HAVE_INT16 are deprecated.\n   * Enabling POLARSSL_NET_C without POLARSSL_HAVE_IPV6 is deprecated.\n   * compat-1.2.h and openssl.h are deprecated.\n   * Adjusting/overriding CFLAGS and LDFLAGS with the make build system is now\n     more flexible (warning: OFLAGS is not used any more) (see the README)\n     (contributed by Alon Bar-Lev).\n   * ssl_set_own_cert() no longer calls pk_check_pair() since the\n     performance impact was bad for some users (this was introduced in 1.3.10).\n   * Move from SHA-1 to SHA-256 in example programs using signatures\n     (suggested by Thorsten M\u00fchlfelder).\n   * Remove some unneeded inclusions of header files from the standard library\n     \"minimize\" others

aborted due\n     to a failed verification (found by Fredrik Axelsson).\n   * Skip writing and parsing signature_algorithm extension if none of the\n     key exchanges enabled needs certificates. This fixes a possible interop\n     issue with some servers when a zero-length extension was sent. (Reported\n     by Peter Dettman.)\n   * On a 0-length input, base64_encode() did not correctly set output length\n     (found by Hendrik van den Boogaard).\n\nChanges\n   * Use deterministic nonces
