{"buggy_code": ["Configuration file\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n.. contents:: Topics\n\n.. highlight:: bash\n\nCertain settings in Ansible are adjustable via a configuration file.  The stock configuration should be sufficient\nfor most users, but there may be reasons you would want to change them.\n\nChanges can be made and used in a configuration file which will be processed in the following order::\n\n    * ANSIBLE_CONFIG (an environment variable)\n    * ansible.cfg (in the current directory)\n    * .ansible.cfg (in the home directory)\n    * /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg\n\nPrior to 1.5 the order was::\n\n    * ansible.cfg (in the current directory)\n    * ANSIBLE_CONFIG (an environment variable)\n    * .ansible.cfg (in the home directory)\n    * /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg\n\nAnsible will process the above list and use the first file found. Settings in files are not merged.\n\n.. note:: Comments\n    The configuration file is one variant of an INI format.  Both the hash\n    sign (\"#\") and semicolon (\";\") are allowed as comment markers when the\n    comment starts the line.  However, if the comment is inline with regular\n    values, only the semicolon is allowed to introduce the comment.  For\n    instance::\n\n        # some basic default values...\n        inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts  ; This points to the file that lists your hosts\n\n.. _getting_the_latest_configuration:\n\nGetting the latest configuration\n````````````````````````````````\n\nIf installing ansible from a package manager, the latest ansible.cfg should be present in /etc/ansible, possibly\nas a \".rpmnew\" file (or other) as appropriate in the case of updates.\n\nIf you have installed from pip or from source, however, you may want to create this file in order to override\ndefault settings in Ansible.\n\nYou may wish to consult the `ansible.cfg in source control <https://raw.github.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/ansible.cfg>`_ for all of the possible latest values.\n\n.. _environmental_configuration:\n\nEnvironmental configuration\n```````````````````````````\n\nAnsible also allows configuration of settings via environment variables.  If\nthese environment variables are set, they will override any setting loaded\nfrom the configuration file.  These variables are defined in `constants.py <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/constants.py>`_.\n\n.. _config_values_by_section:\n\nExplanation of values by section\n````````````````````````````````\n\nThe configuration file is broken up into sections.  Most options are in the \"general\" section but some sections of the file\nare specific to certain connection types.\n\n.. _general_defaults:\n\nGeneral defaults\n----------------\n\nIn the [defaults] section of ansible.cfg, the following settings are tunable:\n\n.. _cfg_action_plugins:\n\naction_plugins\n==============\n\nActions are pieces of code in ansible that enable things like module execution, templating, and so forth.\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n   action_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/action_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/action_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details.\n\n\n.. _allow_world_readable_tmpfiles:\n\nallow_world_readable_tmpfiles\n=============================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1\n\nThis makes the temporary files created on the machine to be world readable and will issue a warning instead of failing the task.\n\nIt is useful when becoming an unprivileged user::\n\n  allow_world_readable_tmpfiles=True\n\n\n\n\n.. _ansible_managed:\n\nansible_managed\n===============\n\nThe ``ansible_managed`` string can be inserted into files written by\nAnsible's config templating system::\n\n   {{ ansible_managed }}\n\nThe default value indicates that Ansible is managing a file::\n\n    ansible_managed = Ansible managed\n\nThis string can be helpful to indicate that a file should not\nbe directly edited because Ansible may overwrite the contents of the file.\n\nThere are several special placeholder values that can be placed in the ``ansible_managed`` string.  These are not in the default ``ansible_managed`` string because they can cause Ansible to behave as though the\nentire template has changed when only the ansible_managed string has\nchanged.  \n\nThese placeholder values, along with the situations which can lead Ansible to\nreport a template as changed when they are used, are listed below:\n\n* Standard directives that can be used with :func:~time.strftime:.\n  The time referred to is the modification time of the template file.  Many\n  revision control systems timestamp files according to when they are checked\n  out, not the last time the file was modified.  That means Ansible will think\n  the file has been modified anytime there is a fresh checkout.\n\n.. If intersphinx isn't turned on, manually make strftime link to\n   https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime\n\n* ``{file}``: expands to the name of the full path to the template file.  If\n  Ansible is run with multiple checkouts of the same configuration repository\n  (for instance, in each sysadmin's home directory), then the path will differ\n  in each checkout causing Ansible to behave as though the file has been modified.  \n* ``{host}``: expands to the hostname of the machine :program:`ansible` is run\n  on.  If :program:`ansible` is invoked on multiple machines (for instance,\n  each sysadmin can checkout the configuration repository on their workstation\n  and run :program:`ansible` there), then the host will vary on each of these\n  machines.  This will cause Ansible to behave as though the file has been modified.\n* ``{uid}``: expands to the owner of the template file.  If Ansible is run\n  on checkouts of the configuration repository made by separate users (for\n  instance, if multiple system administrators are making checkouts of the\n  repository with their own accounts) then this will cause Ansible to behave as if\n  the file has been modified.\n\n.. _ask_pass:\n\nask_pass\n========\n\nThis controls whether an Ansible playbook should prompt for a password by default.  The default behavior is no::\n\n    ask_pass = True\n\nIf using SSH keys for authentication, it's probably not needed to change this setting.\n\n.. _ask_sudo_pass:\n\nask_sudo_pass\n=============\n\nSimilar to ask_pass, this controls whether an Ansible playbook should prompt for a sudo password by default when\nsudoing.  The default behavior is also no::\n\n    ask_sudo_pass = True\n\nUsers on platforms where sudo passwords are enabled should consider changing this setting.\n\n.. _ask_vault_pass:\n\nask_vault_pass\n==============\n\nThis controls whether an Ansible playbook should prompt for the vault password by default.  The default behavior is no::\n\n    ask_vault_pass = True\n\n.. _bin_ansible_callbacks:\n\nbin_ansible_callbacks\n=====================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.8\n\nControls whether callback plugins are loaded when running /usr/bin/ansible.  This may be used to log activity from\nthe command line, send notifications, and so on.  Callback plugins are always loaded for /usr/bin/ansible-playbook\nif present and cannot be disabled::\n\n    bin_ansible_callbacks = False\n\nPrior to 1.8, callbacks were never loaded for /usr/bin/ansible.\n\n.. _callback_plugins:\n\ncallback_plugins\n================\n\nCallbacks are pieces of code in ansible that get called on specific events, permitting to trigger notifications.\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n   callback_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/callback:/usr/share/ansible/plugins/callback\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n.. _callback_whitelist:\n\ncallback_whitelist\n==================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.0\n\nNow ansible ships with all included callback plugins ready to use but they are disabled by default.\nThis setting lets you enable a list of additional callbacks. This cannot change or override the\ndefault stdout callback, use :ref:`stdout_callback` for that::\n\n    callback_whitelist = timer,mail\n\n.. _command_warnings:\n\ncommand_warnings\n================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.8\n\nBy default since Ansible 1.8, Ansible will issue a warning when the shell or \ncommand module is used and the command appears to be similar to an existing \nAnsible module. For example, this can include reminders to use the 'git' module\ninstead of shell commands to execute 'git'.  Using modules when possible over \narbitrary shell commands can lead to more reliable and consistent playbook runs, \nand also easier to maintain playbooks::\n\n    command_warnings = False\n\nThese warnings can be silenced by adjusting the following\nsetting or adding warn=yes or warn=no to the end of the command line\nparameter string, like so::\n\n\n    - name: usage of git that could be replaced with the git module\n      shell: git update foo warn=yes\n\n.. _connection_plugins:\n\nconnection_plugins\n==================\n\nConnections plugin permit to extend the channel used by ansible to transport commands and files.\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n    connection_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/connection_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/connection_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n.. _deprecation_warnings:\n\ndeprecation_warnings\n====================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.3\n\nAllows disabling of deprecating warnings in ansible-playbook output::\n\n    deprecation_warnings = True\n\nDeprecation warnings indicate usage of legacy features that are slated for removal in a future release of Ansible.\n\n.. _display_args_to_stdout:\n\ndisplay_args_to_stdout\n======================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1.0\n\nBy default, ansible-playbook will print a header for each task that is run to\nstdout.  These headers will contain the ``name:`` field from the task if you\nspecified one.  If you didn't then ansible-playbook uses the task's action to\nhelp you tell which task is presently running.  Sometimes you run many of the\nsame action and so you want more information about the task to differentiate\nit from others of the same action.  If you set this variable to ``True`` in\nthe config then ansible-playbook will also include the task's arguments in the\nheader.\n\nThis setting defaults to ``False`` because there is a chance that you have\nsensitive values in your parameters and do not want those to be printed to\nstdout::\n\n    display_args_to_stdout = False\n\nIf you set this to ``True`` you should be sure that you have secured your\nenvironment's stdout (no one can shoulder surf your screen and you aren't\nsaving stdout to an insecure file) or made sure that all of your playbooks\nexplicitly added the ``no_log: True`` parameter to tasks which have sensistive\nvalues   See :ref:`keep_secret_data` for more information.\n\n.. _display_skipped_hosts:\n\ndisplay_skipped_hosts\n=====================\n\nIf set to `False`, ansible will not display any status for a task that is skipped. The default behavior is to display skipped tasks::\n\n    display_skipped_hosts = True\n\nNote that Ansible will always show the task header for any task, regardless of whether or not the task is skipped.\n\n.. _error_on_undefined_vars:\n\nerror_on_undefined_vars\n=======================\n\nOn by default since Ansible 1.3, this causes ansible to fail steps that reference variable names that are likely\ntypoed::\n\n    error_on_undefined_vars = True\n\nIf set to False, any '{{ template_expression }}' that contains undefined variables will be rendered in a template\nor ansible action line exactly as written.\n\n.. _executable:\n\nexecutable\n==========\n\nThis indicates the command to use to spawn a shell under a sudo environment.  Users may need to change this to /bin/bash in rare instances when sudo is constrained, but in most cases it may be left as is::\n\n    executable = /bin/bash\n\nStarting in version 2.1 this can be overridden by the inventory var ``ansible_shell_executable``.\n\n.. _filter_plugins:\n\nfilter_plugins\n==============\n\nFilters are specific functions that can be used to extend the template system.\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n    filter_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/filter_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/filter_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n.. _force_color:\n\nforce_color\n===========\n\nThis options forces color mode even when running without a TTY::\n\n    force_color = 1\n\n.. _force_handlers:\n\nforce_handlers\n==============\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.9.1\n\nThis option causes notified handlers to run on a host even if a failure occurs on that host::\n\n    force_handlers = True\n\nThe default is False, meaning that handlers will not run if a failure has occurred on a host.\nThis can also be set per play or on the command line. See :ref:`handlers_and_failure` for more details.\n\n.. _forks:\n\nforks\n=====\n\nThis is the default number of parallel processes to spawn when communicating with remote hosts.  Since Ansible 1.3,\nthe fork number is automatically limited to the number of possible hosts at runtime, so this is really a limit of how much\nnetwork and CPU load you think you can handle.  Many users may set this to 50, some set it to 500 or more.  If you\nhave a large number of hosts, higher values will make actions across all of those hosts complete faster.  The default\nis very very conservative::\n\n    forks = 5\n\n.. _fact_path:\n\nfact_path\n=========\n\nThis option allows you to globally configure a custom path for :ref:`_local_facts`:: for the implied `setup` task when using implied fact gathering.\n\n  fact_path = /home/centos/ansible_facts.d\n\nThe default is to use the default from the `setup module  <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/setup_module.html>`_: ``/etc/ansible/facts.d``\nThis ONLY affects fact gathering triggered by a play when `gather_facts: True`.\n\n.. _gathering:\n\ngathering\n=========\n\nNew in 1.6, the 'gathering' setting controls the default policy of facts gathering (variables discovered about remote systems).\n\nThe value 'implicit' is the default, which means that the fact cache will be ignored and facts will be gathered per play unless 'gather_facts: False' is set.\nThe value 'explicit' is the inverse, facts will not be gathered unless directly requested in the play.\nThe value 'smart' means each new host that has no facts discovered will be scanned, but if the same host is addressed in multiple plays it will not be contacted again in the playbook run.\nThis option can be useful for those wishing to save fact gathering time. Both 'smart' and 'explicit' will use the fact cache::\n\n    gathering = smart\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1\n\nYou can specify a subset of gathered facts, via the play's gather_facts directive, using the following option::\n\n    gather_subset = all\n\n:all: gather all subsets (the default)\n:network: gather network facts\n:hardware: gather hardware facts (longest facts to retrieve)\n:virtual: gather facts about virtual machines hosted on the machine\n:ohai: gather facts from ohai\n:facter: gather facts from facter\n\nYou can combine them using a comma separated list (ex: network,virtual,facter)\n\nYou can also disable specific subsets by prepending with a `!` like this::\n\n    # Don't gather hardware facts, facts from chef's ohai or puppet's facter\n    gather_subset = !hardware,!ohai,!facter\n\nA set of basic facts are always collected no matter which additional subsets\nare selected.  If you want to collect the minimal amount of facts, use\n`!all`::\n\n    gather_subset = !all\n\nhash_behaviour\n==============\n\nAnsible by default will override variables in specific precedence orders, as described in :doc:`playbooks_variables`.  When a variable\nof higher precedence wins, it will replace the other value.\n\nSome users prefer that variables that are hashes (aka 'dictionaries' in Python terms) are merged.  This setting is called 'merge'. This is not the default behavior and it does not affect variables whose values are scalars (integers, strings) or\narrays.  We generally recommend not using this setting unless you think you have an absolute need for it, and playbooks in the\nofficial examples repos do not use this setting::\n\n    hash_behaviour = replace\n\nThe valid values are either 'replace' (the default) or 'merge'.\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.0\n\nIf you want to merge hashes without changing the global settings, use\nthe `combine` filter described in :doc:`playbooks_filters`.\n\n.. _hostfile:\n\nhostfile\n========\n\nThis is a deprecated setting since 1.9, please look at :ref:`inventory_file` for the new setting.\n\n.. _host_key_checking:\n\nhost_key_checking\n=================\n\nAs described in :doc:`intro_getting_started`, host key checking is on by default in Ansible 1.3 and later.  If you understand the\nimplications and wish to disable it, you may do so here by setting the value to False::\n\n    host_key_checking = True\n\n.. _internal_poll_interval:\n\ninternal_poll_interval\n======================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.2\n\nThis sets the interval (in seconds) of Ansible internal processes polling each other.\nLower values improve performance with large playbooks at the expense of extra CPU load.\nHigher values are more suitable for Ansible usage in automation scenarios, when UI responsiveness is not required but CPU usage might be a concern.\nDefault corresponds to the value hardcoded in Ansible \u2264 2.1::\n\n    internal_poll_interval=0.001\n\n.. _inventory_file:\n\ninventory\n=========\n\nThis is the default location of the inventory file, script, or directory that Ansible will use to determine what hosts it has available\nto talk to::\n\n    inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts\n\nIt used to be called hostfile in Ansible before 1.9\n\n.. _inventory_ignore_extensions:\n\ninventory_ignore_extensions\n===========================\n\nComma-separated list of file extension patterns to ignore when Ansible inventory\nis a directory with multiple sources (static and dynamic)::\n\n    inventory_ignore_extensions = ~, .orig, .bak, .ini, .cfg, .retry, .pyc, .pyo\n\nThis option can be overridden by setting ``ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_IGNORE``\nenvironment variable.\n\n.. _jinja2_extensions:\n\njinja2_extensions\n=================\n\nThis is a developer-specific feature that allows enabling additional Jinja2 extensions::\n\n    jinja2_extensions = jinja2.ext.do,jinja2.ext.i18n\n\nIf you do not know what these do, you probably don't need to change this setting :)\n\n.. _library:\n\nlibrary\n=======\n\nThis is the default location Ansible looks to find modules::\n\n     library = /usr/share/ansible\n\nAnsible can look in multiple locations if you feed it a colon\nseparated path, and it also will look for modules in the :file:`./library`\ndirectory alongside a playbook.\n\nThis can be used to manage modules pulled from several different locations.\nFor instance, a site wishing to checkout modules from several different git\nrepositories might handle it like this:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    $ mkdir -p /srv/modules\n    $ cd /srv/modules\n    $ git checkout https://vendor_modules .\n    $ git checkout ssh://custom_modules .\n    $ export ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=/srv/modules/custom_modules:/srv/modules/vendor_modules\n    $ ansible [...]\n\nIn case of modules with the same name, the library paths are searched in order\nand the first module found with that name is used.\n\n.. _local_tmp:\n\nlocal_tmp\n=========\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1\n\nWhen Ansible gets ready to send a module to a remote machine it usually has to\nadd a few things to the module: Some boilerplate code, the module's\nparameters, and a few constants from the config file.  This combination of\nthings gets stored in a temporary file until ansible exits and cleans up after\nitself.  The default location is a subdirectory of the user's home directory.\nIf you'd like to change that, you can do so by altering this setting::\n\n    local_tmp = ~/.ansible/tmp\n\nAnsible will then choose a random directory name inside this location.\n\n.. _log_path:\n\nlog_path\n========\n\nIf present and configured in ansible.cfg, Ansible will log information about executions at the designated location.  Be sure\nthe user running Ansible has permissions on the logfile::\n\n    log_path=/var/log/ansible.log\n\nThis behavior is not on by default.  Note that ansible will, without this setting, record module arguments called to the\nsyslog of managed machines.  Password arguments are excluded.\n\nFor Enterprise users seeking more detailed logging history, you may be interested in :doc:`tower`.\n\n.. _lookup_plugins:\n\nlookup_plugins\n==============\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n    lookup_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/lookup_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/lookup_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n.. _merge_multiple_cli_tags:\n\nmerge_multiple_cli_tags\n=======================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.3\n\nThis allows changing how multiple :option:`--tags` and :option:`--skip-tags`\narguments are handled on the command line.  Specifying :option:`--tags` more\nthan once merges all of the :option:`--tags` options together.  If you want\nthe pre-2.4.x behaviour where only the last value of :option:`--tags` is used,\nthen set this to False.  The same holds true for :option:`--skip-tags`.\n\n.. note:: The default value for this in 2.3 is False.  In 2.4, the\n    default value is True.  After 2.8, the option will be removed.\n    Multiple :option:`--tags` and multiple :option:`--skip-tags` will always\n    be merged together.\n\n.. _module_lang:\n\nmodule_lang\n===========\n\nThis is to set the default language to communicate between the module and the system.\nBy default, the value is value `LANG` on the controller or, if unset, `en_US.UTF-8` (it used to be `C` in previous versions)::\n\n    module_lang = en_US.UTF-8\n\n.. note::\n\n    This is only used if :ref:`module_set_locale` is set to True.\n\n.. _module_name:\n\nmodule_name\n===========\n\nThis is the default module name (-m) value for /usr/bin/ansible.  The default is the 'command' module.\nRemember the command module doesn't support shell variables, pipes, or quotes, so you might wish to change\nit to 'shell'::\n\n    module_name = command\n\n.. _module_set_locale:\n\nmodule_set_locale\n=================\n\nThis boolean value controls whether or not Ansible will prepend locale-specific environment variables (as specified\nvia the :ref:`module_lang` configuration option). If enabled, it results in the LANG, LC_MESSAGES, and LC_ALL\nbeing set when the module is executed on the given remote system.  By default this is disabled.\n\n.. note::\n\n    The module_set_locale option was added in Ansible-2.1 and defaulted to\n    True.  The default was changed to False in Ansible-2.2\n\n.. _module_utils:\n\nmodule_utils\n============\n\nThis is the default location Ansible looks to find module_utils::\n\n    module_utils = /usr/share/ansible/my_module_utils\n\nmodule_utils are python modules that Ansible is able to combine with Ansible\nmodules when sending them to the remote machine.  Having custom module_utils\nis useful for extracting common code when developing a set of site-specific\nmodules.\n\nAnsible can look in multiple locations if you feed it a colon\nseparated path, and it also will look for modules in the\n:file:`./module_utils` directory alongside a playbook.\n\n.. _nocolor:\n\nnocolor\n=======\n\nBy default ansible will try to colorize output to give a better indication of failure and status information.\nIf you dislike this behavior you can turn it off by setting 'nocolor' to 1::\n\n    nocolor = 0\n\n.. _nocows:\n\nnocows\n======\n\nBy default ansible will take advantage of cowsay if installed to make /usr/bin/ansible-playbook runs more exciting.\nWhy?  We believe systems management should be a happy experience.  If you do not like the cows, you can disable them\nby setting 'nocows' to 1::\n\n    nocows = 0\n\n.. _pattern:\n\npattern\n=======\n\nThis is the default group of hosts to talk to in a playbook if no \"hosts:\" stanza is supplied.  The default is to talk\nto all hosts.  You may wish to change this to protect yourself from surprises::\n\n    hosts = *\n\nNote that /usr/bin/ansible always requires a host pattern and does not use this setting, only /usr/bin/ansible-playbook.\n\n.. _poll_interval:\n\npoll_interval\n=============\n\nFor asynchronous tasks in Ansible (covered in :doc:`playbooks_async`), this is how often to check back on the status of those\ntasks when an explicit poll interval is not supplied.  The default is a reasonably moderate 15 seconds which is a tradeoff\nbetween checking in frequently and providing a quick turnaround when something may have completed::\n\n    poll_interval = 15\n\n.. _private_key_file:\n\nprivate_key_file\n================\n\nIf you are using a pem file to authenticate with machines rather than SSH agent or passwords, you can set the default\nvalue here to avoid re-specifying ``--private-key`` with every invocation::\n\n    private_key_file=/path/to/file.pem\n\n.. _remote_port:\n\nremote_port\n===========\n\nThis sets the default SSH port on all of your systems, for systems that didn't specify an alternative value in inventory.\nThe default is the standard 22::\n\n    remote_port = 22\n\n.. _remote_tmp:\n\nremote_tmp\n==========\n\nAnsible works by transferring modules to your remote machines, running them, and then cleaning up after itself.  In some\ncases, you may not wish to use the default location and would like to change the path.  You can do so by altering this\nsetting::\n\n    remote_tmp = ~/.ansible/tmp\n\nThe default is to use a subdirectory of the user's home directory.  Ansible will then choose a random directory name\ninside this location.\n\n.. _remote_user:\n\nremote_user\n===========\n\nThis is the default username ansible will connect as for /usr/bin/ansible-playbook.  Note that /usr/bin/ansible will\nalways default to the current user if this is not defined::\n\n    remote_user = root\n\n\n.. _restrict_facts_namespace:\n\nrestrict_facts_namespace\n========================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.4\n\nThis allows restricting facts in their own namespace (under ansible_facts) instead of pushing them into the main.\nFalse by default. Can also be set via the environment variable `ANSIBLE_RESTRICT_FACTS`. Using `ansible_system` as an example:\n\nWhen False::\n\n    - debug: var=ansible_system\n\n\nWhen True::\n\n    - debug: var=ansible_facts.ansible_system\n\n\n.. _retry_files_enabled:\n\nretry_files_enabled\n===================\n\nThis controls whether a failed Ansible playbook should create a .retry file. The default setting is True::\n\n    retry_files_enabled = False\n\n.. _retry_files_save_path:\n\nretry_files_save_path\n=====================\n\nThe retry files save path is where Ansible will save .retry files when a playbook fails and retry_files_enabled is True (the default).\nThe default location is adjacent to the play (~/ in versions older than 2.0) and can be changed to any writeable path::\n\n    retry_files_save_path = ~/.ansible/retry-files\n\nThe directory will be created if it does not already exist.\n\n.. _cfg_roles_path:\n\nroles_path\n==========\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.4\n\nThe roles path indicate additional directories beyond the 'roles/' subdirectory of a playbook project to search to find Ansible\nroles.  For instance, if there was a source control repository of common roles and a different repository of playbooks, you might\nchoose to establish a convention to checkout roles in /opt/mysite/roles like so::\n\n    roles_path = /opt/mysite/roles\n\nAdditional paths can be provided separated by colon characters, in the same way as other pathstrings::\n\n    roles_path = /opt/mysite/roles:/opt/othersite/roles\n\nRoles will be first searched for in the playbook directory.  Should a role not be found, it will indicate all the possible paths\nthat were searched.\n\n.. _cfg_squash_actions:\n\nsquash_actions\n==============\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.0\n\nAnsible can optimise actions that call modules that support list parameters when using with\\_ looping.\nInstead of calling the module once for each item, the module is called once with the full list.\n\nThe default value for this setting is only for certain package managers, but it can be used for any module::\n\n    squash_actions = apk,apt,dnf,homebrew,package,pacman,pkgng,yum,zypper\n\nCurrently, this is only supported for modules that have a name parameter, and only when the item is the\nonly thing being passed to the parameter.\n\n.. _stdout_callback:\n\nstdout_callback\n===============\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.0\n\nThis setting allows you to override the default stdout callback for ansible-playbook::\n\n    stdout_callback = skippy\n\n.. _cfg_strategy_plugins:\n\nstrategy_plugins\n==================\n\nStrategy plugin allow users to change the way in which Ansible runs tasks on targeted hosts.\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n    strategy_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/strategy_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/strategy_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n.. _cfg_strategy:\n\nstrategy\n========\n\nStrategy allow to change the default strategy used by Ansible::\n\n    strategy = free\n\n.. _sudo_exe:\n\nsudo_exe\n========\n\nIf using an alternative sudo implementation on remote machines, the path to sudo can be replaced here provided\nthe sudo implementation is matching CLI flags with the standard sudo::\n\n   sudo_exe = sudo\n\n.. _sudo_flags:\n\nsudo_flags\n==========\n\nAdditional flags to pass to sudo when engaging sudo support. The default is '-H -S -n' which sets the HOME environment\nvariable, prompts for passwords via STDIN, and avoids prompting the user for input of any kind. Note that '-n' will conflict\nwith using password-less sudo auth, such as pam_ssh_agent_auth. In some situations you may wish to add or remove flags, but\nin general most users will not need to change this setting:::\n\n   sudo_flags=-H -S -n\n\n.. _sudo_user:\n\nsudo_user\n=========\n\nThis is the default user to sudo to if ``--sudo-user`` is not specified or 'sudo_user' is not specified in an Ansible\nplaybook.  The default is the most logical: 'root'::\n\n   sudo_user = root\n\n.. _system_warnings:\n\nsystem_warnings\n===============\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.6\n\nAllows disabling of warnings related to potential issues on the system running ansible itself (not on the managed hosts)::\n\n   system_warnings = True\n\nThese may include warnings about 3rd party packages or other conditions that should be resolved if possible.\n\n.. _timeout:\n\ntimeout\n=======\n\nThis is the default SSH timeout to use on connection attempts::\n\n    timeout = 10\n\n.. _transport:\n\ntransport\n=========\n\nThis is the default transport to use if \"-c <transport_name>\" is not specified to /usr/bin/ansible or /usr/bin/ansible-playbook.\nThe default is 'smart', which will use 'ssh' (OpenSSH based) if the local operating system is new enough to support ControlPersist\ntechnology, and then will otherwise use 'paramiko'.  Other transport options include 'local', 'chroot', 'jail', and so on.\n\nUsers should usually leave this setting as 'smart' and let their playbooks choose an alternate setting when needed with the\n'connection:' play parameter::\n\n    transport = paramiko\n\n.. _vars_plugins:\n\nvars_plugins\n============\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n    vars_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/vars_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/vars_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n\n.. _vault_password_file:\n\nvault_password_file\n===================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.7\n\nConfigures the path to the Vault password file as an alternative to specifying ``--vault-password-file`` on the command line::\n\n   vault_password_file = /path/to/vault_password_file\n\nAs of 1.7 this file can also be a script. If you are using a script instead of a flat file, ensure that it is marked as executable, and that the password is printed to standard output. If your script needs to prompt for data, prompts can be sent to standard error.\n\n.. _privilege_escalation:\n\nPrivilege Escalation Settings\n-----------------------------\n\nAnsible can use existing privilege escalation systems to allow a user to execute tasks as another. As of 1.9 \u2018become\u2019 supersedes the old sudo/su, while still being backwards compatible.  Settings live under the [privilege_escalation] header.\n\n.. _become:\n\nbecome\n======\n\nThe equivalent of adding sudo: or su: to a play or task, set to true/yes to activate privilege escalation. The default behavior is no::\n\n    become = True\n\n.. _become_method:\n\nbecome_method\n=============\n\nSet the privilege escalation method. The default is ``sudo``, other options are ``su``, ``pbrun``, ``pfexec``, ``doas``, ``ksu``::\n\n    become_method = su\n\n.. _become_user:\n\nbecome_user\n=============\n\nThe equivalent to ansible_sudo_user or ansible_su_user, allows to set the user you become through privilege escalation. The default is 'root'::\n\n    become_user = root\n\n.. _become_ask_pass:\n\nbecome_ask_pass\n===============\n\nAsk for privilege escalation password, the default is False::\n\n    become_ask_pass = True\n\n.. _become_allow_same_user:\n\nbecome_allow_same_user\n======================\n\nMost of the time, using *sudo* to run a command as the same user who is running\n*sudo* itself is unnecessary overhead, so Ansible does not allow it. However,\ndepending on the *sudo* configuration, it may be necessary to run a command as\nthe same user through *sudo*, such as to switch SELinux contexts. For this\nreason, you can set ``become_allow_same_user`` to ``True`` and disable this\noptimization.\n\n.. _paramiko_settings:\n\nParamiko Specific Settings\n--------------------------\n\nParamiko is the default SSH connection implementation on Enterprise Linux 6 or earlier, and is not used by default on other\nplatforms.  Settings live under the [paramiko_connection] header.\n\n.. _record_host_keys:\n\nrecord_host_keys\n================\n\nThe default setting of yes will record newly discovered and approved (if host key checking is enabled) hosts in the user's hostfile.\nThis setting may be inefficient for large numbers of hosts, and in those situations, using the ssh transport is definitely recommended\ninstead.  Setting it to False will improve performance and is recommended when host key checking is disabled::\n\n    record_host_keys = True\n\n.. _paramiko_proxy_command:\n\nproxy_command\n=============\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1\n\nUse an OpenSSH like ProxyCommand for proxying all Paramiko SSH connections through a bastion or jump host. Requires a minimum of Paramiko version 1.9.0. On Enterprise Linux 6 this is provided by ``python-paramiko1.10`` in the EPEL repository::\n\n    proxy_command = ssh -W \"%h:%p\" bastion\n\n.. _openssh_settings:\n\nOpenSSH Specific Settings\n-------------------------\n\nUnder the [ssh_connection] header, the following settings are tunable for SSH connections.  OpenSSH is the default connection type for Ansible\non OSes that are new enough to support ControlPersist.  (This means basically all operating systems except Enterprise Linux 6 or earlier).\n\n.. _ssh_args:\n\nssh_args\n========\n\nIf set, this will pass a specific set of options to Ansible rather than Ansible's usual defaults::\n\n    ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s\n\nIn particular, users may wish to raise the ControlPersist time to encourage performance.  A value of 30 minutes may\nbe appropriate. If ``-o ControlPath`` is set in ``ssh_args``, the ``control_path`` setting is not used.\n\n.. _control_path:\n\ncontrol_path\n============\n\nThis is the location to save ControlPath sockets. This defaults to::\n\n    control_path=%(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r\n\nOn some systems with very long hostnames or very long path names (caused by long user names or\ndeeply nested home directories) this can exceed the character limit on\nfile socket names (108 characters for most platforms). In that case, you\nmay wish to shorten the string to something like the below::\n\n    control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r\n\nAnsible 1.4 and later will instruct users to run with \"-vvvv\" in situations where it hits this problem\nand if so it is easy to tell there is too long of a Control Path filename.  This may be frequently\nencountered on EC2. This setting is ignored if ``-o ControlPath`` is set in ``ssh_args``.\n\n.. _control_path_dir:\n\ncontrol_path_dir\n================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.3\n\nThis is the base directory of the ControlPath sockets.\nIt is the ``%(directory)s`` part of the ``control_path`` option.\nThis defaults to::\n\n    control_path_dir=~/.ansible/cp\n\n.. _retries:\n\nretries\n=======\n\nAdds the option to retry failed ssh executions if the failure is encountered in ssh itself, not the remote command. This can be helpful if there are transient network issues. Enabled by setting retries to an integer greater than 1. Defaults to::\n\n    retries = 0\n\n.. _scp_if_ssh:\n\nscp_if_ssh\n==========\n\nOccasionally users may be managing a remote system that doesn't have SFTP enabled.  If set to True, we can\ncause scp to be used to transfer remote files instead::\n\n    scp_if_ssh = False\n\nThere's really no reason to change this unless problems are encountered, and then there's also no real drawback\nto managing the switch.  Most environments support SFTP by default and this doesn't usually need to be changed.\n\n\n.. _pipelining:\n\npipelining\n==========\n\nEnabling pipelining reduces the number of SSH operations required to\nexecute a module on the remote server, by executing many ansible modules without actual file transfer.\nThis can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled, however when using \"sudo:\" operations you must\nfirst disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts.\n\nBy default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with\nsudoers configurations that have requiretty (the default on many distros), but is highly\nrecommended if you can enable it, eliminating the need for :doc:`playbooks_acceleration`::\n\n    pipelining = False\n\n.. _ssh_executable:\n\nssh_executable\n==============\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.2\n\nThis is the location of the ssh binary. It defaults to ``ssh`` which will use the first ssh binary available in ``$PATH``. This config can also be overridden with ``ansible_ssh_executable`` inventory variable::\n\n  ssh_executable=\"/usr/local/bin/ssh\"\n\nThis option is usually not required, it might be useful when access to system ssh is restricted, or when using ssh wrappers to connect to remote hosts. \n\n.. _accelerate_settings:\n\nAccelerated Mode Settings\n-------------------------\n\nUnder the [accelerate] header, the following settings are tunable for :doc:`playbooks_acceleration`.  Acceleration is\na useful performance feature to use if you cannot enable :ref:`pipelining` in your environment, but is probably\nnot needed if you can.\n\n.. _accelerate_port:\n\naccelerate_port\n===============\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.3\n\nThis is the port to use for accelerated mode::\n\n    accelerate_port = 5099\n\n.. _accelerate_timeout:\n\naccelerate_timeout\n==================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.4\n\nThis setting controls the timeout for receiving data from a client. If no data is received during this time, the socket connection will be closed. A keepalive packet is sent back to the controller every 15 seconds, so this timeout should not be set lower than 15 (by default, the timeout is 30 seconds)::\n\n    accelerate_timeout = 30\n\n.. _accelerate_connect_timeout:\n\naccelerate_connect_timeout\n==========================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.4\n\nThis setting controls the timeout for the socket connect call, and should be kept relatively low. The connection to the `accelerate_port` will be attempted 3 times before Ansible will fall back to ssh or paramiko (depending on your default connection setting) to try and start the accelerate daemon remotely. The default setting is 1.0 seconds::\n\n    accelerate_connect_timeout = 1.0\n\nNote, this value can be set to less than one second, however it is probably not a good idea to do so unless you're on a very fast and reliable LAN. If you're connecting to systems over the internet, it may be necessary to increase this timeout.\n\n.. _accelerate_daemon_timeout:\n\naccelerate_daemon_timeout\n=========================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.6\n\nThis setting controls the timeout for the accelerated daemon, as measured in minutes. The default daemon timeout is 30 minutes::\n\n    accelerate_daemon_timeout = 30\n\nNote, prior to 1.6, the timeout was hard-coded from the time of the daemon's launch. For version 1.6+, the timeout is now based on the last activity to the daemon and is configurable via this option.\n\n.. _accelerate_multi_key:\n\naccelerate_multi_key\n====================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.6\n\nIf enabled, this setting allows multiple private keys to be uploaded to the daemon. Any clients connecting to the daemon must also enable this option::\n\n    accelerate_multi_key = yes\n\nNew clients first connect to the target node over SSH to upload the key, which is done via a local socket file, so they must have the same access as the user that launched the daemon originally.\n\n.. _selinux_settings:\n\nSelinux Specific Settings\n-------------------------\n\nThese are settings that control SELinux interactions.\n\n\nspecial_context_filesystems\n===========================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.9\n\nThis is a list of file systems that require special treatment when dealing with security context.\nThe normal behaviour is for operations to copy the existing context or use the user default, this changes it to use a file system dependent context.\nThe default list is: nfs,vboxsf,fuse,ramfs::\n\n    special_context_filesystems = nfs,vboxsf,fuse,ramfs,myspecialfs\n\nlibvirt_lxc_noseclabel\n======================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1\n\nThis setting causes libvirt to connect to lxc containers by passing --noseclabel to virsh.\nThis is necessary when running on systems which do not have SELinux.\nThe default behavior is no::\n\n    libvirt_lxc_noseclabel = True\n\n.. _show_custom_stats:\n\nshow_custom_stats\n=================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.3\n\nIf enabled, this setting will display custom stats (set via set_stats plugin) when using the default callback.\n\n\nGalaxy Settings\n---------------\n\nThe following options can be set in the [galaxy] section of ansible.cfg:\n\nserver\n======\n\nOverride the default Galaxy server value of https://galaxy.ansible.com. Useful if you have a hosted version of the Galaxy web app or want to point to the testing site https://galaxy-qa.ansible.com. It does not work against private, hosted repos, which Galaxy can use for fetching and installing roles.\n\nignore_certs\n============\n\nIf set to *yes*, ansible-galaxy will not validate TLS certificates. This can be useful for testing against a server with a self-signed certificate.\n\n", "# config file for ansible -- https://ansible.com/\n# ===============================================\n\n# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook\n# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,\n# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in\n# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it\n# finds first\n\n[defaults]\n\n# some basic default values...\n\n#inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts\n#library        = /usr/share/my_modules/\n#module_utils   = /usr/share/my_module_utils/\n#remote_tmp     = ~/.ansible/tmp\n#local_tmp      = ~/.ansible/tmp\n#forks          = 5\n#poll_interval  = 15\n#sudo_user      = root\n#ask_sudo_pass = True\n#ask_pass      = True\n#transport      = smart\n#remote_port    = 22\n#module_lang    = C\n#module_set_locale = False\n\n# plays will gather facts by default, which contain information about\n# the remote system.\n#\n# smart - gather by default, but don't regather if already gathered\n# implicit - gather by default, turn off with gather_facts: False\n# explicit - do not gather by default, must say gather_facts: True\n#gathering = implicit\n\n# This only affects the gathering done by a play's gather_facts directive,\n# by default gathering retrieves all facts subsets\n# all - gather all subsets\n# network - gather min and network facts\n# hardware - gather hardware facts (longest facts to retrieve)\n# virtual - gather min and virtual facts\n# facter - import facts from facter\n# ohai - import facts from ohai\n# You can combine them using comma (ex: network,virtual)\n# You can negate them using !

The stock configuration should be sufficient\nfor most users, but there may be reasons you would want to change them.\n\nChanges can be made and used in a configuration file which will be processed in the following order::\n\n    * ANSIBLE_CONFIG (an environment variable)\n    * ansible.cfg (in the current directory)\n    * .ansible.cfg (in the home directory)\n    * /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg\n\nPrior to 1.5 the order was::\n\n    * ansible.cfg (in the current directory)\n    * ANSIBLE_CONFIG (an environment variable)\n    * .ansible.cfg (in the home directory)\n    * /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg\n\nAnsible will process the above list and use the first file found. Settings in files are not merged.\n\n.. note:: Comments\n    The configuration file is one variant of an INI format.  Both the hash\n    sign (\"#\") and semicolon (\";\") are allowed as comment markers when the\n    comment starts the line.  However, if the comment is inline with regular\n    values, only the semicolon is allowed to introduce the comment.  For\n    instance::\n\n        # some basic default values...\n        inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts  ; This points to the file that lists your hosts\n\n.. _getting_the_latest_configuration:\n\nGetting the latest configuration\n````````````````````````````````\n\nIf installing ansible from a package manager, the latest ansible.cfg should be present in /etc/ansible, possibly\nas a \".rpmnew\" file (or other) as appropriate in the case of updates.\n\nIf you have installed from pip or from source, however, you may want to create this file in order to override\ndefault settings in Ansible.\n\nYou may wish to consult the `ansible.cfg in source control <https://raw.github.com/ansible/ansible/devel/examples/ansible.cfg>`_ for all of the possible latest values.\n\n.. _environmental_configuration:\n\nEnvironmental configuration\n```````````````````````````\n\nAnsible also allows configuration of settings via environment variables.  If\nthese environment variables are set, they will override any setting loaded\nfrom the configuration file.  These variables are defined in `constants.py <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/lib/ansible/constants.py>`_.\n\n.. _config_values_by_section:\n\nExplanation of values by section\n````````````````````````````````\n\nThe configuration file is broken up into sections.  Most options are in the \"general\" section but some sections of the file\nare specific to certain connection types.\n\n.. _general_defaults:\n\nGeneral defaults\n----------------\n\nIn the [defaults] section of ansible.cfg, the following settings are tunable:\n\n.. _cfg_action_plugins:\n\naction_plugins\n==============\n\nActions are pieces of code in ansible that enable things like module execution, templating, and so forth.\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n   action_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/action_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/action_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details.\n\n\n.. _allow_unsafe_lookups:\n\nallow_unsafe_lookups\n====================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.2.3, 2.3.1\n\nWhen enabled, this option allows lookup plugins (whether used in variables as `{{lookup('foo')}}` or as a loop as `with_foo`) to return data that is **not** marked \"unsafe\". By default, such data is marked as unsafe to prevent the templating engine from evaluating any jinja2 templating language, as this could represent a security risk.\n\nThis option is provided to allow for backwards-compatibility, however users should first consider adding `allow_unsafe=True` to any lookups which may be expected to contain data which may be run through the templating engine later. For example::\n\n    {{lookup('pipe', '/path/to/some/command', allow_unsafe=True)}}\n\n\n.. _allow_world_readable_tmpfiles:\n\nallow_world_readable_tmpfiles\n=============================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1\n\nThis makes the temporary files created on the machine to be world readable and will issue a warning instead of failing the task.\n\nIt is useful when becoming an unprivileged user::\n\n  allow_world_readable_tmpfiles=True\n\n\n\n\n.. _ansible_managed:\n\nansible_managed\n===============\n\nThe ``ansible_managed`` string can be inserted into files written by\nAnsible's config templating system::\n\n   {{ ansible_managed }}\n\nThe default value indicates that Ansible is managing a file::\n\n    ansible_managed = Ansible managed\n\nThis string can be helpful to indicate that a file should not\nbe directly edited because Ansible may overwrite the contents of the file.\n\nThere are several special placeholder values that can be placed in the ``ansible_managed`` string.  These are not in the default ``ansible_managed`` string because they can cause Ansible to behave as though the\nentire template has changed when only the ansible_managed string has\nchanged.  \n\nThese placeholder values, along with the situations which can lead Ansible to\nreport a template as changed when they are used, are listed below:\n\n* Standard directives that can be used with :func:~time.strftime:.\n  The time referred to is the modification time of the template file.  Many\n  revision control systems timestamp files according to when they are checked\n  out, not the last time the file was modified.  That means Ansible will think\n  the file has been modified anytime there is a fresh checkout.\n\n.. If intersphinx isn't turned on, manually make strftime link to\n   https://docs.python.org/2/library/time.html#time.strftime\n\n* ``{file}``: expands to the name of the full path to the template file.  If\n  Ansible is run with multiple checkouts of the same configuration repository\n  (for instance, in each sysadmin's home directory), then the path will differ\n  in each checkout causing Ansible to behave as though the file has been modified.  \n* ``{host}``: expands to the hostname of the machine :program:`ansible` is run\n  on.  If :program:`ansible` is invoked on multiple machines (for instance,\n  each sysadmin can checkout the configuration repository on their workstation\n  and run :program:`ansible` there), then the host will vary on each of these\n  machines.  This will cause Ansible to behave as though the file has been modified.\n* ``{uid}``: expands to the owner of the template file.  If Ansible is run\n  on checkouts of the configuration repository made by separate users (for\n  instance, if multiple system administrators are making checkouts of the\n  repository with their own accounts) then this will cause Ansible to behave as if\n  the file has been modified.\n\n.. _ask_pass:\n\nask_pass\n========\n\nThis controls whether an Ansible playbook should prompt for a password by default.  The default behavior is no::\n\n    ask_pass = True\n\nIf using SSH keys for authentication, it's probably not needed to change this setting.\n\n.. _ask_sudo_pass:\n\nask_sudo_pass\n=============\n\nSimilar to ask_pass, this controls whether an Ansible playbook should prompt for a sudo password by default when\nsudoing.  The default behavior is also no::\n\n    ask_sudo_pass = True\n\nUsers on platforms where sudo passwords are enabled should consider changing this setting.\n\n.. _ask_vault_pass:\n\nask_vault_pass\n==============\n\nThis controls whether an Ansible playbook should prompt for the vault password by default.  The default behavior is no::\n\n    ask_vault_pass = True\n\n.. _bin_ansible_callbacks:\n\nbin_ansible_callbacks\n=====================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.8\n\nControls whether callback plugins are loaded when running /usr/bin/ansible.  This may be used to log activity from\nthe command line, send notifications, and so on.  Callback plugins are always loaded for /usr/bin/ansible-playbook\nif present and cannot be disabled::\n\n    bin_ansible_callbacks = False\n\nPrior to 1.8, callbacks were never loaded for /usr/bin/ansible.\n\n.. _callback_plugins:\n\ncallback_plugins\n================\n\nCallbacks are pieces of code in ansible that get called on specific events, permitting to trigger notifications.\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n   callback_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/callback:/usr/share/ansible/plugins/callback\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n.. _callback_whitelist:\n\ncallback_whitelist\n==================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.0\n\nNow ansible ships with all included callback plugins ready to use but they are disabled by default.\nThis setting lets you enable a list of additional callbacks. This cannot change or override the\ndefault stdout callback, use :ref:`stdout_callback` for that::\n\n    callback_whitelist = timer,mail\n\n.. _command_warnings:\n\ncommand_warnings\n================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.8\n\nBy default since Ansible 1.8, Ansible will issue a warning when the shell or \ncommand module is used and the command appears to be similar to an existing \nAnsible module. For example, this can include reminders to use the 'git' module\ninstead of shell commands to execute 'git'.  Using modules when possible over \narbitrary shell commands can lead to more reliable and consistent playbook runs, \nand also easier to maintain playbooks::\n\n    command_warnings = False\n\nThese warnings can be silenced by adjusting the following\nsetting or adding warn=yes or warn=no to the end of the command line\nparameter string, like so::\n\n\n    - name: usage of git that could be replaced with the git module\n      shell: git update foo warn=yes\n\n.. _connection_plugins:\n\nconnection_plugins\n==================\n\nConnections plugin permit to extend the channel used by ansible to transport commands and files.\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n    connection_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/connection_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/connection_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n.. _deprecation_warnings:\n\ndeprecation_warnings\n====================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.3\n\nAllows disabling of deprecating warnings in ansible-playbook output::\n\n    deprecation_warnings = True\n\nDeprecation warnings indicate usage of legacy features that are slated for removal in a future release of Ansible.\n\n.. _display_args_to_stdout:\n\ndisplay_args_to_stdout\n======================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1.0\n\nBy default, ansible-playbook will print a header for each task that is run to\nstdout.  These headers will contain the ``name:`` field from the task if you\nspecified one.  If you didn't then ansible-playbook uses the task's action to\nhelp you tell which task is presently running.  Sometimes you run many of the\nsame action and so you want more information about the task to differentiate\nit from others of the same action.  If you set this variable to ``True`` in\nthe config then ansible-playbook will also include the task's arguments in the\nheader.\n\nThis setting defaults to ``False`` because there is a chance that you have\nsensitive values in your parameters and do not want those to be printed to\nstdout::\n\n    display_args_to_stdout = False\n\nIf you set this to ``True`` you should be sure that you have secured your\nenvironment's stdout (no one can shoulder surf your screen and you aren't\nsaving stdout to an insecure file) or made sure that all of your playbooks\nexplicitly added the ``no_log: True`` parameter to tasks which have sensistive\nvalues   See :ref:`keep_secret_data` for more information.\n\n.. _display_skipped_hosts:\n\ndisplay_skipped_hosts\n=====================\n\nIf set to `False`, ansible will not display any status for a task that is skipped. The default behavior is to display skipped tasks::\n\n    display_skipped_hosts = True\n\nNote that Ansible will always show the task header for any task, regardless of whether or not the task is skipped.\n\n.. _error_on_undefined_vars:\n\nerror_on_undefined_vars\n=======================\n\nOn by default since Ansible 1.3, this causes ansible to fail steps that reference variable names that are likely\ntypoed::\n\n    error_on_undefined_vars = True\n\nIf set to False, any '{{ template_expression }}' that contains undefined variables will be rendered in a template\nor ansible action line exactly as written.\n\n.. _executable:\n\nexecutable\n==========\n\nThis indicates the command to use to spawn a shell under a sudo environment.  Users may need to change this to /bin/bash in rare instances when sudo is constrained, but in most cases it may be left as is::\n\n    executable = /bin/bash\n\nStarting in version 2.1 this can be overridden by the inventory var ``ansible_shell_executable``.\n\n.. _filter_plugins:\n\nfilter_plugins\n==============\n\nFilters are specific functions that can be used to extend the template system.\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n    filter_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/filter_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/filter_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n.. _force_color:\n\nforce_color\n===========\n\nThis options forces color mode even when running without a TTY::\n\n    force_color = 1\n\n.. _force_handlers:\n\nforce_handlers\n==============\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.9.1\n\nThis option causes notified handlers to run on a host even if a failure occurs on that host::\n\n    force_handlers = True\n\nThe default is False, meaning that handlers will not run if a failure has occurred on a host.\nThis can also be set per play or on the command line. See :ref:`handlers_and_failure` for more details.\n\n.. _forks:\n\nforks\n=====\n\nThis is the default number of parallel processes to spawn when communicating with remote hosts.  Since Ansible 1.3,\nthe fork number is automatically limited to the number of possible hosts at runtime, so this is really a limit of how much\nnetwork and CPU load you think you can handle.  Many users may set this to 50, some set it to 500 or more.  If you\nhave a large number of hosts, higher values will make actions across all of those hosts complete faster.  The default\nis very very conservative::\n\n    forks = 5\n\n.. _fact_path:\n\nfact_path\n=========\n\nThis option allows you to globally configure a custom path for :ref:`_local_facts`:: for the implied `setup` task when using implied fact gathering.\n\n  fact_path = /home/centos/ansible_facts.d\n\nThe default is to use the default from the `setup module  <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/setup_module.html>`_: ``/etc/ansible/facts.d``\nThis ONLY affects fact gathering triggered by a play when `gather_facts: True`.\n\n.. _gathering:\n\ngathering\n=========\n\nNew in 1.6, the 'gathering' setting controls the default policy of facts gathering (variables discovered about remote systems).\n\nThe value 'implicit' is the default, which means that the fact cache will be ignored and facts will be gathered per play unless 'gather_facts: False' is set.\nThe value 'explicit' is the inverse, facts will not be gathered unless directly requested in the play.\nThe value 'smart' means each new host that has no facts discovered will be scanned, but if the same host is addressed in multiple plays it will not be contacted again in the playbook run.\nThis option can be useful for those wishing to save fact gathering time. Both 'smart' and 'explicit' will use the fact cache::\n\n    gathering = smart\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1\n\nYou can specify a subset of gathered facts, via the play's gather_facts directive, using the following option::\n\n    gather_subset = all\n\n:all: gather all subsets (the default)\n:network: gather network facts\n:hardware: gather hardware facts (longest facts to retrieve)\n:virtual: gather facts about virtual machines hosted on the machine\n:ohai: gather facts from ohai\n:facter: gather facts from facter\n\nYou can combine them using a comma separated list (ex: network,virtual,facter)\n\nYou can also disable specific subsets by prepending with a `!` like this::\n\n    # Don't gather hardware facts, facts from chef's ohai or puppet's facter\n    gather_subset = !hardware,!ohai,!facter\n\nA set of basic facts are always collected no matter which additional subsets\nare selected.  If you want to collect the minimal amount of facts, use\n`!all`::\n\n    gather_subset = !all\n\nhash_behaviour\n==============\n\nAnsible by default will override variables in specific precedence orders, as described in :doc:`playbooks_variables`.  When a variable\nof higher precedence wins, it will replace the other value.\n\nSome users prefer that variables that are hashes (aka 'dictionaries' in Python terms) are merged.  This setting is called 'merge'. This is not the default behavior and it does not affect variables whose values are scalars (integers, strings) or\narrays.  We generally recommend not using this setting unless you think you have an absolute need for it, and playbooks in the\nofficial examples repos do not use this setting::\n\n    hash_behaviour = replace\n\nThe valid values are either 'replace' (the default) or 'merge'.\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.0\n\nIf you want to merge hashes without changing the global settings, use\nthe `combine` filter described in :doc:`playbooks_filters`.\n\n.. _hostfile:\n\nhostfile\n========\n\nThis is a deprecated setting since 1.9, please look at :ref:`inventory_file` for the new setting.\n\n.. _host_key_checking:\n\nhost_key_checking\n=================\n\nAs described in :doc:`intro_getting_started`, host key checking is on by default in Ansible 1.3 and later.  If you understand the\nimplications and wish to disable it, you may do so here by setting the value to False::\n\n    host_key_checking = True\n\n.. _internal_poll_interval:\n\ninternal_poll_interval\n======================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.2\n\nThis sets the interval (in seconds) of Ansible internal processes polling each other.\nLower values improve performance with large playbooks at the expense of extra CPU load.\nHigher values are more suitable for Ansible usage in automation scenarios, when UI responsiveness is not required but CPU usage might be a concern.\nDefault corresponds to the value hardcoded in Ansible \u2264 2.1::\n\n    internal_poll_interval=0.001\n\n.. _inventory_file:\n\ninventory\n=========\n\nThis is the default location of the inventory file, script, or directory that Ansible will use to determine what hosts it has available\nto talk to::\n\n    inventory = /etc/ansible/hosts\n\nIt used to be called hostfile in Ansible before 1.9\n\n.. _inventory_ignore_extensions:\n\ninventory_ignore_extensions\n===========================\n\nComma-separated list of file extension patterns to ignore when Ansible inventory\nis a directory with multiple sources (static and dynamic)::\n\n    inventory_ignore_extensions = ~, .orig, .bak, .ini, .cfg, .retry, .pyc, .pyo\n\nThis option can be overridden by setting ``ANSIBLE_INVENTORY_IGNORE``\nenvironment variable.\n\n.. _jinja2_extensions:\n\njinja2_extensions\n=================\n\nThis is a developer-specific feature that allows enabling additional Jinja2 extensions::\n\n    jinja2_extensions = jinja2.ext.do,jinja2.ext.i18n\n\nIf you do not know what these do, you probably don't need to change this setting :)\n\n.. _library:\n\nlibrary\n=======\n\nThis is the default location Ansible looks to find modules::\n\n     library = /usr/share/ansible\n\nAnsible can look in multiple locations if you feed it a colon\nseparated path, and it also will look for modules in the :file:`./library`\ndirectory alongside a playbook.\n\nThis can be used to manage modules pulled from several different locations.\nFor instance, a site wishing to checkout modules from several different git\nrepositories might handle it like this:\n\n.. code-block:: shell-session\n\n    $ mkdir -p /srv/modules\n    $ cd /srv/modules\n    $ git checkout https://vendor_modules .\n    $ git checkout ssh://custom_modules .\n    $ export ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=/srv/modules/custom_modules:/srv/modules/vendor_modules\n    $ ansible [...]\n\nIn case of modules with the same name, the library paths are searched in order\nand the first module found with that name is used.\n\n.. _local_tmp:\n\nlocal_tmp\n=========\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1\n\nWhen Ansible gets ready to send a module to a remote machine it usually has to\nadd a few things to the module: Some boilerplate code, the module's\nparameters, and a few constants from the config file.  This combination of\nthings gets stored in a temporary file until ansible exits and cleans up after\nitself.  The default location is a subdirectory of the user's home directory.\nIf you'd like to change that, you can do so by altering this setting::\n\n    local_tmp = ~/.ansible/tmp\n\nAnsible will then choose a random directory name inside this location.\n\n.. _log_path:\n\nlog_path\n========\n\nIf present and configured in ansible.cfg, Ansible will log information about executions at the designated location.  Be sure\nthe user running Ansible has permissions on the logfile::\n\n    log_path=/var/log/ansible.log\n\nThis behavior is not on by default.  Note that ansible will, without this setting, record module arguments called to the\nsyslog of managed machines.  Password arguments are excluded.\n\nFor Enterprise users seeking more detailed logging history, you may be interested in :doc:`tower`.\n\n.. _lookup_plugins:\n\nlookup_plugins\n==============\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n    lookup_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/lookup_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/lookup_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n.. _merge_multiple_cli_tags:\n\nmerge_multiple_cli_tags\n=======================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.3\n\nThis allows changing how multiple :option:`--tags` and :option:`--skip-tags`\narguments are handled on the command line.  Specifying :option:`--tags` more\nthan once merges all of the :option:`--tags` options together.  If you want\nthe pre-2.4.x behaviour where only the last value of :option:`--tags` is used,\nthen set this to False.  The same holds true for :option:`--skip-tags`.\n\n.. note:: The default value for this in 2.3 is False.  In 2.4, the\n    default value is True.  After 2.8, the option will be removed.\n    Multiple :option:`--tags` and multiple :option:`--skip-tags` will always\n    be merged together.\n\n.. _module_lang:\n\nmodule_lang\n===========\n\nThis is to set the default language to communicate between the module and the system.\nBy default, the value is value `LANG` on the controller or, if unset, `en_US.UTF-8` (it used to be `C` in previous versions)::\n\n    module_lang = en_US.UTF-8\n\n.. note::\n\n    This is only used if :ref:`module_set_locale` is set to True.\n\n.. _module_name:\n\nmodule_name\n===========\n\nThis is the default module name (-m) value for /usr/bin/ansible.  The default is the 'command' module.\nRemember the command module doesn't support shell variables, pipes, or quotes, so you might wish to change\nit to 'shell'::\n\n    module_name = command\n\n.. _module_set_locale:\n\nmodule_set_locale\n=================\n\nThis boolean value controls whether or not Ansible will prepend locale-specific environment variables (as specified\nvia the :ref:`module_lang` configuration option). If enabled, it results in the LANG, LC_MESSAGES, and LC_ALL\nbeing set when the module is executed on the given remote system.  By default this is disabled.\n\n.. note::\n\n    The module_set_locale option was added in Ansible-2.1 and defaulted to\n    True.  The default was changed to False in Ansible-2.2\n\n.. _module_utils:\n\nmodule_utils\n============\n\nThis is the default location Ansible looks to find module_utils::\n\n    module_utils = /usr/share/ansible/my_module_utils\n\nmodule_utils are python modules that Ansible is able to combine with Ansible\nmodules when sending them to the remote machine.  Having custom module_utils\nis useful for extracting common code when developing a set of site-specific\nmodules.\n\nAnsible can look in multiple locations if you feed it a colon\nseparated path, and it also will look for modules in the\n:file:`./module_utils` directory alongside a playbook.\n\n.. _nocolor:\n\nnocolor\n=======\n\nBy default ansible will try to colorize output to give a better indication of failure and status information.\nIf you dislike this behavior you can turn it off by setting 'nocolor' to 1::\n\n    nocolor = 0\n\n.. _nocows:\n\nnocows\n======\n\nBy default ansible will take advantage of cowsay if installed to make /usr/bin/ansible-playbook runs more exciting.\nWhy?  We believe systems management should be a happy experience.  If you do not like the cows, you can disable them\nby setting 'nocows' to 1::\n\n    nocows = 0\n\n.. _pattern:\n\npattern\n=======\n\nThis is the default group of hosts to talk to in a playbook if no \"hosts:\" stanza is supplied.  The default is to talk\nto all hosts.  You may wish to change this to protect yourself from surprises::\n\n    hosts = *\n\nNote that /usr/bin/ansible always requires a host pattern and does not use this setting, only /usr/bin/ansible-playbook.\n\n.. _poll_interval:\n\npoll_interval\n=============\n\nFor asynchronous tasks in Ansible (covered in :doc:`playbooks_async`), this is how often to check back on the status of those\ntasks when an explicit poll interval is not supplied.  The default is a reasonably moderate 15 seconds which is a tradeoff\nbetween checking in frequently and providing a quick turnaround when something may have completed::\n\n    poll_interval = 15\n\n.. _private_key_file:\n\nprivate_key_file\n================\n\nIf you are using a pem file to authenticate with machines rather than SSH agent or passwords, you can set the default\nvalue here to avoid re-specifying ``--private-key`` with every invocation::\n\n    private_key_file=/path/to/file.pem\n\n.. _remote_port:\n\nremote_port\n===========\n\nThis sets the default SSH port on all of your systems, for systems that didn't specify an alternative value in inventory.\nThe default is the standard 22::\n\n    remote_port = 22\n\n.. _remote_tmp:\n\nremote_tmp\n==========\n\nAnsible works by transferring modules to your remote machines, running them, and then cleaning up after itself.  In some\ncases, you may not wish to use the default location and would like to change the path.  You can do so by altering this\nsetting::\n\n    remote_tmp = ~/.ansible/tmp\n\nThe default is to use a subdirectory of the user's home directory.  Ansible will then choose a random directory name\ninside this location.\n\n.. _remote_user:\n\nremote_user\n===========\n\nThis is the default username ansible will connect as for /usr/bin/ansible-playbook.  Note that /usr/bin/ansible will\nalways default to the current user if this is not defined::\n\n    remote_user = root\n\n\n.. _restrict_facts_namespace:\n\nrestrict_facts_namespace\n========================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.4\n\nThis allows restricting facts in their own namespace (under ansible_facts) instead of pushing them into the main.\nFalse by default. Can also be set via the environment variable `ANSIBLE_RESTRICT_FACTS`. Using `ansible_system` as an example:\n\nWhen False::\n\n    - debug: var=ansible_system\n\n\nWhen True::\n\n    - debug: var=ansible_facts.ansible_system\n\n\n.. _retry_files_enabled:\n\nretry_files_enabled\n===================\n\nThis controls whether a failed Ansible playbook should create a .retry file. The default setting is True::\n\n    retry_files_enabled = False\n\n.. _retry_files_save_path:\n\nretry_files_save_path\n=====================\n\nThe retry files save path is where Ansible will save .retry files when a playbook fails and retry_files_enabled is True (the default).\nThe default location is adjacent to the play (~/ in versions older than 2.0) and can be changed to any writeable path::\n\n    retry_files_save_path = ~/.ansible/retry-files\n\nThe directory will be created if it does not already exist.\n\n.. _cfg_roles_path:\n\nroles_path\n==========\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.4\n\nThe roles path indicate additional directories beyond the 'roles/' subdirectory of a playbook project to search to find Ansible\nroles.  For instance, if there was a source control repository of common roles and a different repository of playbooks, you might\nchoose to establish a convention to checkout roles in /opt/mysite/roles like so::\n\n    roles_path = /opt/mysite/roles\n\nAdditional paths can be provided separated by colon characters, in the same way as other pathstrings::\n\n    roles_path = /opt/mysite/roles:/opt/othersite/roles\n\nRoles will be first searched for in the playbook directory.  Should a role not be found, it will indicate all the possible paths\nthat were searched.\n\n.. _cfg_squash_actions:\n\nsquash_actions\n==============\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.0\n\nAnsible can optimise actions that call modules that support list parameters when using with\\_ looping.\nInstead of calling the module once for each item, the module is called once with the full list.\n\nThe default value for this setting is only for certain package managers, but it can be used for any module::\n\n    squash_actions = apk,apt,dnf,homebrew,package,pacman,pkgng,yum,zypper\n\nCurrently, this is only supported for modules that have a name parameter, and only when the item is the\nonly thing being passed to the parameter.\n\n.. _stdout_callback:\n\nstdout_callback\n===============\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.0\n\nThis setting allows you to override the default stdout callback for ansible-playbook::\n\n    stdout_callback = skippy\n\n.. _cfg_strategy_plugins:\n\nstrategy_plugins\n==================\n\nStrategy plugin allow users to change the way in which Ansible runs tasks on targeted hosts.\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n    strategy_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/strategy_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/strategy_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n.. _cfg_strategy:\n\nstrategy\n========\n\nStrategy allow to change the default strategy used by Ansible::\n\n    strategy = free\n\n.. _sudo_exe:\n\nsudo_exe\n========\n\nIf using an alternative sudo implementation on remote machines, the path to sudo can be replaced here provided\nthe sudo implementation is matching CLI flags with the standard sudo::\n\n   sudo_exe = sudo\n\n.. _sudo_flags:\n\nsudo_flags\n==========\n\nAdditional flags to pass to sudo when engaging sudo support. The default is '-H -S -n' which sets the HOME environment\nvariable, prompts for passwords via STDIN, and avoids prompting the user for input of any kind. Note that '-n' will conflict\nwith using password-less sudo auth, such as pam_ssh_agent_auth. In some situations you may wish to add or remove flags, but\nin general most users will not need to change this setting:::\n\n   sudo_flags=-H -S -n\n\n.. _sudo_user:\n\nsudo_user\n=========\n\nThis is the default user to sudo to if ``--sudo-user`` is not specified or 'sudo_user' is not specified in an Ansible\nplaybook.  The default is the most logical: 'root'::\n\n   sudo_user = root\n\n.. _system_warnings:\n\nsystem_warnings\n===============\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.6\n\nAllows disabling of warnings related to potential issues on the system running ansible itself (not on the managed hosts)::\n\n   system_warnings = True\n\nThese may include warnings about 3rd party packages or other conditions that should be resolved if possible.\n\n.. _timeout:\n\ntimeout\n=======\n\nThis is the default SSH timeout to use on connection attempts::\n\n    timeout = 10\n\n.. _transport:\n\ntransport\n=========\n\nThis is the default transport to use if \"-c <transport_name>\" is not specified to /usr/bin/ansible or /usr/bin/ansible-playbook.\nThe default is 'smart', which will use 'ssh' (OpenSSH based) if the local operating system is new enough to support ControlPersist\ntechnology, and then will otherwise use 'paramiko'.  Other transport options include 'local', 'chroot', 'jail', and so on.\n\nUsers should usually leave this setting as 'smart' and let their playbooks choose an alternate setting when needed with the\n'connection:' play parameter::\n\n    transport = paramiko\n\n.. _vars_plugins:\n\nvars_plugins\n============\n\nThis is a developer-centric feature that allows low-level extensions around Ansible to be loaded from\ndifferent locations::\n\n    vars_plugins = ~/.ansible/plugins/vars_plugins/:/usr/share/ansible_plugins/vars_plugins\n\nMost users will not need to use this feature.  See :doc:`dev_guide/developing_plugins` for more details\n\n\n.. _vault_password_file:\n\nvault_password_file\n===================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.7\n\nConfigures the path to the Vault password file as an alternative to specifying ``--vault-password-file`` on the command line::\n\n   vault_password_file = /path/to/vault_password_file\n\nAs of 1.7 this file can also be a script. If you are using a script instead of a flat file, ensure that it is marked as executable, and that the password is printed to standard output. If your script needs to prompt for data, prompts can be sent to standard error.\n\n.. _privilege_escalation:\n\nPrivilege Escalation Settings\n-----------------------------\n\nAnsible can use existing privilege escalation systems to allow a user to execute tasks as another. As of 1.9 \u2018become\u2019 supersedes the old sudo/su, while still being backwards compatible.  Settings live under the [privilege_escalation] header.\n\n.. _become:\n\nbecome\n======\n\nThe equivalent of adding sudo: or su: to a play or task, set to true/yes to activate privilege escalation. The default behavior is no::\n\n    become = True\n\n.. _become_method:\n\nbecome_method\n=============\n\nSet the privilege escalation method. The default is ``sudo``, other options are ``su``, ``pbrun``, ``pfexec``, ``doas``, ``ksu``::\n\n    become_method = su\n\n.. _become_user:\n\nbecome_user\n=============\n\nThe equivalent to ansible_sudo_user or ansible_su_user, allows to set the user you become through privilege escalation. The default is 'root'::\n\n    become_user = root\n\n.. _become_ask_pass:\n\nbecome_ask_pass\n===============\n\nAsk for privilege escalation password, the default is False::\n\n    become_ask_pass = True\n\n.. _become_allow_same_user:\n\nbecome_allow_same_user\n======================\n\nMost of the time, using *sudo* to run a command as the same user who is running\n*sudo* itself is unnecessary overhead, so Ansible does not allow it. However,\ndepending on the *sudo* configuration, it may be necessary to run a command as\nthe same user through *sudo*, such as to switch SELinux contexts. For this\nreason, you can set ``become_allow_same_user`` to ``True`` and disable this\noptimization.\n\n.. _paramiko_settings:\n\nParamiko Specific Settings\n--------------------------\n\nParamiko is the default SSH connection implementation on Enterprise Linux 6 or earlier, and is not used by default on other\nplatforms.  Settings live under the [paramiko_connection] header.\n\n.. _record_host_keys:\n\nrecord_host_keys\n================\n\nThe default setting of yes will record newly discovered and approved (if host key checking is enabled) hosts in the user's hostfile.\nThis setting may be inefficient for large numbers of hosts, and in those situations, using the ssh transport is definitely recommended\ninstead.  Setting it to False will improve performance and is recommended when host key checking is disabled::\n\n    record_host_keys = True\n\n.. _paramiko_proxy_command:\n\nproxy_command\n=============\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1\n\nUse an OpenSSH like ProxyCommand for proxying all Paramiko SSH connections through a bastion or jump host. Requires a minimum of Paramiko version 1.9.0. On Enterprise Linux 6 this is provided by ``python-paramiko1.10`` in the EPEL repository::\n\n    proxy_command = ssh -W \"%h:%p\" bastion\n\n.. _openssh_settings:\n\nOpenSSH Specific Settings\n-------------------------\n\nUnder the [ssh_connection] header, the following settings are tunable for SSH connections.  OpenSSH is the default connection type for Ansible\non OSes that are new enough to support ControlPersist.  (This means basically all operating systems except Enterprise Linux 6 or earlier).\n\n.. _ssh_args:\n\nssh_args\n========\n\nIf set, this will pass a specific set of options to Ansible rather than Ansible's usual defaults::\n\n    ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s\n\nIn particular, users may wish to raise the ControlPersist time to encourage performance.  A value of 30 minutes may\nbe appropriate. If ``-o ControlPath`` is set in ``ssh_args``, the ``control_path`` setting is not used.\n\n.. _control_path:\n\ncontrol_path\n============\n\nThis is the location to save ControlPath sockets. This defaults to::\n\n    control_path=%(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r\n\nOn some systems with very long hostnames or very long path names (caused by long user names or\ndeeply nested home directories) this can exceed the character limit on\nfile socket names (108 characters for most platforms). In that case, you\nmay wish to shorten the string to something like the below::\n\n    control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r\n\nAnsible 1.4 and later will instruct users to run with \"-vvvv\" in situations where it hits this problem\nand if so it is easy to tell there is too long of a Control Path filename.  This may be frequently\nencountered on EC2. This setting is ignored if ``-o ControlPath`` is set in ``ssh_args``.\n\n.. _control_path_dir:\n\ncontrol_path_dir\n================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.3\n\nThis is the base directory of the ControlPath sockets.\nIt is the ``%(directory)s`` part of the ``control_path`` option.\nThis defaults to::\n\n    control_path_dir=~/.ansible/cp\n\n.. _retries:\n\nretries\n=======\n\nAdds the option to retry failed ssh executions if the failure is encountered in ssh itself, not the remote command. This can be helpful if there are transient network issues. Enabled by setting retries to an integer greater than 1. Defaults to::\n\n    retries = 0\n\n.. _scp_if_ssh:\n\nscp_if_ssh\n==========\n\nOccasionally users may be managing a remote system that doesn't have SFTP enabled.  If set to True, we can\ncause scp to be used to transfer remote files instead::\n\n    scp_if_ssh = False\n\nThere's really no reason to change this unless problems are encountered, and then there's also no real drawback\nto managing the switch.  Most environments support SFTP by default and this doesn't usually need to be changed.\n\n\n.. _pipelining:\n\npipelining\n==========\n\nEnabling pipelining reduces the number of SSH operations required to\nexecute a module on the remote server, by executing many ansible modules without actual file transfer.\nThis can result in a very significant performance improvement when enabled, however when using \"sudo:\" operations you must\nfirst disable 'requiretty' in /etc/sudoers on all managed hosts.\n\nBy default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with\nsudoers configurations that have requiretty (the default on many distros), but is highly\nrecommended if you can enable it, eliminating the need for :doc:`playbooks_acceleration`::\n\n    pipelining = False\n\n.. _ssh_executable:\n\nssh_executable\n==============\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.2\n\nThis is the location of the ssh binary. It defaults to ``ssh`` which will use the first ssh binary available in ``$PATH``. This config can also be overridden with ``ansible_ssh_executable`` inventory variable::\n\n  ssh_executable=\"/usr/local/bin/ssh\"\n\nThis option is usually not required, it might be useful when access to system ssh is restricted, or when using ssh wrappers to connect to remote hosts. \n\n.. _accelerate_settings:\n\nAccelerated Mode Settings\n-------------------------\n\nUnder the [accelerate] header, the following settings are tunable for :doc:`playbooks_acceleration`.  Acceleration is\na useful performance feature to use if you cannot enable :ref:`pipelining` in your environment, but is probably\nnot needed if you can.\n\n.. _accelerate_port:\n\naccelerate_port\n===============\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.3\n\nThis is the port to use for accelerated mode::\n\n    accelerate_port = 5099\n\n.. _accelerate_timeout:\n\naccelerate_timeout\n==================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.4\n\nThis setting controls the timeout for receiving data from a client. If no data is received during this time, the socket connection will be closed. A keepalive packet is sent back to the controller every 15 seconds, so this timeout should not be set lower than 15 (by default, the timeout is 30 seconds)::\n\n    accelerate_timeout = 30\n\n.. _accelerate_connect_timeout:\n\naccelerate_connect_timeout\n==========================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.4\n\nThis setting controls the timeout for the socket connect call, and should be kept relatively low. The connection to the `accelerate_port` will be attempted 3 times before Ansible will fall back to ssh or paramiko (depending on your default connection setting) to try and start the accelerate daemon remotely. The default setting is 1.0 seconds::\n\n    accelerate_connect_timeout = 1.0\n\nNote, this value can be set to less than one second, however it is probably not a good idea to do so unless you're on a very fast and reliable LAN. If you're connecting to systems over the internet, it may be necessary to increase this timeout.\n\n.. _accelerate_daemon_timeout:\n\naccelerate_daemon_timeout\n=========================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.6\n\nThis setting controls the timeout for the accelerated daemon, as measured in minutes. The default daemon timeout is 30 minutes::\n\n    accelerate_daemon_timeout = 30\n\nNote, prior to 1.6, the timeout was hard-coded from the time of the daemon's launch. For version 1.6+, the timeout is now based on the last activity to the daemon and is configurable via this option.\n\n.. _accelerate_multi_key:\n\naccelerate_multi_key\n====================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.6\n\nIf enabled, this setting allows multiple private keys to be uploaded to the daemon. Any clients connecting to the daemon must also enable this option::\n\n    accelerate_multi_key = yes\n\nNew clients first connect to the target node over SSH to upload the key, which is done via a local socket file, so they must have the same access as the user that launched the daemon originally.\n\n.. _selinux_settings:\n\nSelinux Specific Settings\n-------------------------\n\nThese are settings that control SELinux interactions.\n\n\nspecial_context_filesystems\n===========================\n\n.. versionadded:: 1.9\n\nThis is a list of file systems that require special treatment when dealing with security context.\nThe normal behaviour is for operations to copy the existing context or use the user default, this changes it to use a file system dependent context.\nThe default list is: nfs,vboxsf,fuse,ramfs::\n\n    special_context_filesystems = nfs,vboxsf,fuse,ramfs,myspecialfs\n\nlibvirt_lxc_noseclabel\n======================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.1\n\nThis setting causes libvirt to connect to lxc containers by passing --noseclabel to virsh.\nThis is necessary when running on systems which do not have SELinux.\nThe default behavior is no::\n\n    libvirt_lxc_noseclabel = True\n\n.. _show_custom_stats:\n\nshow_custom_stats\n=================\n\n.. versionadded:: 2.3\n\nIf enabled, this setting will display custom stats (set via set_stats plugin) when using the default callback.\n\n\nGalaxy Settings\n---------------\n\nThe following options can be set in the [galaxy] section of ansible.cfg:\n\nserver\n======\n\nOverride the default Galaxy server value of https://galaxy.ansible.com. Useful if you have a hosted version of the Galaxy web app or want to point to the testing site https://galaxy-qa.ansible.com. It does not work against private, hosted repos, which Galaxy can use for fetching and installing roles.\n\nignore_certs\n============\n\nIf set to *yes*, ansible-galaxy will not validate TLS certificates. This can be useful for testing against a server with a self-signed certificate.\n\n", "# config file for ansible -- https://ansible.com/\n# ===============================================\n\n# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook\n# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,\n# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in\n# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it\n# finds first\n\n[defaults]\n\n# some basic default values...\n\n#inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts\n#library        = /usr/share/my_modules/\n#module_utils   = /usr/share/my_module_utils/\n#remote_tmp     = ~/.ansible/tmp\n#local_tmp      = ~/.ansible/tmp\n#forks          = 5\n#poll_interval  = 15\n#sudo_user      = root\n#ask_sudo_pass = True\n#ask_pass      = True\n#transport      = smart\n#remote_port    = 22\n#module_lang    = C\n#module_set_locale = False\n\n# plays will gather facts by default, which contain information about\n# the remote system.\n#\n# smart - gather by default, but don't regather if already gathered\n# implicit - gather by default, turn off with gather_facts: False\n# explicit - do not gather by default, must say gather_facts: True\n#gathering = implicit\n\n# This only affects the gathering done by a play's gather_facts directive,\n# by default gathering retrieves all facts subsets\n# all - gather all subsets\n# network - gather min and network facts\n# hardware - gather hardware facts (longest facts to retrieve)\n# virtual - gather min and virtual facts\n# facter - import facts from facter\n# ohai - import facts from ohai\n# You can combine them using comma (ex: network,virtual)\n# You can negate them using !
