{"buggy_code": ["# [DEPRECATED] \n# Please use [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector) and the command line version of [Appium](https://github.com/appium/appium) to inspect elements.\n\n\u2757\u2757 This project is no longer maintained since it is not compatible with Appium 2.0+. For Appium 1.x and 2.0+, use the command line Appium server (see the [Appium docs](https://appium.github.io/appium/docs/en/latest/) for installation and setup information), in combination with [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector).\n\nThe old documentation for this project remains below.\n\n# Appium Desktop\n\n[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/AppiumCI/Appium%20Desktop/_apis/build/status/appium.appium-desktop)](https://dev.azure.com/AppiumCI/Appium%20Desktop/_build/latest?definitionId=1)\n[![Crowdin](https://d322cqt584bo4o.cloudfront.net/appium-desktop/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/appium-desktop)\n\n![Action screenshot](docs/images/screen-start-simple.png)\n\nAppium Desktop is an app for Mac, Windows, and Linux which gives you the power of the [Appium](http://appium.io) automation server in a beautiful and flexible UI. It is basically a graphical interface for the Appium Server. You can set options, start/stop the server, see logs, etc... You also don't need to use Node/NPM to install Appium, as the Node runtime comes bundled with Appium Desktop.\n\n**Note:** an inspector UI used to be included with Appium Desktop. It is now its own separate app: [Appium Inspector](https://github.com/appium/appium-inspector).\n\n## Download Appium Desktop\n\nYou can always pick up the latest release of the Server GUI at our\n[Release](https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/latest) page on\nGitHub.\n\nIf you're on Windows or macOS, Appium Desktop will automatically provide you\nwith updated versions of the app when they are released. If you encounter\na problem updating, simply delete or uninstall the app and re-download the\nlatest from the link above.\n\nNote that Appium Desktop _is not_ the same thing as Appium. Appium Desktop is\na graphical frontend to Appium with additional tools. Appium Desktop is\nreleased on its own cadence and has its own versioning system. If you are\nreporting an issue with Appium Desktop, always be sure to include _both_ the\nversion of Appium Desktop and the version of the Appium Server which is in use\n(see below).\n\nIf you're on macOS, you will need to install Appium Desktop apps by copying the app\nfrom the downloaded DMG file to your own file system (the best place is the\n\"Applications\" folder). Running Appium from in side the attached DMG itself is\nnot supported, and will not work.\n\n### Installing on macOS\n\nIf you're using the desktop app on macOS, when you run it you may be greeted with some error about\nthe app not being able to be opened, or not verified by Apple, or something similar. The easiest\nway to get around this is to run `xattr -cr` on the file you downloaded. So let's say you\ndownloaded `Appium-Server-GUI-mac-<version>.dmg` and copy `Appium Server GUI.app` in\n`/Applications` inside the disk image. Then you would run `xattr -cr \"/Applications/Appium Server\nGUI.app\"` before opening it. The same goes for the zip version (or the .app itself).\n\n## Known Issues\n\n* Some Windows 10 Users experience a `PathTooLongException` when installing the EXE. The workaround for this is to update the setting on Windows to [enable long paths](https://superuser.com/questions/1119883/windows-10-enable-ntfs-long-paths-policy-option-missing)\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nThese instructions assume you are already familiar with Appium and Appium-related concepts. If you\nare new to Appium, please visit [appium.io](http://appium.io) and read our introductory material.\nThey also assume that you have downloaded both the Server GUI and the Inspector apps.\n\nThis app provides a convenient way to download and run the Appium automation\nserver, as well as a tool for inspecting elements in Chrome/Safari browser and your Android or iOS application. Its\nvarious capabilities are described in the following sections.\n\n#### Starting a simple server\n\n![Start a basic server](docs/images/screen-start-simple.png)\n\nWhen you open Appium Desktop, you are greeted with the server start window. The\nbasic option is to start an Appium server with all its defaults and the ability\nto modify the host and port. The start button will also let you know which\nversion of the Appium server you are running, which can be useful when\nreporting issues to the Appium team.\n\n#### Starting a server with advanced options\n\n![Start an advanced server](docs/images/screen-start-advanced.png)\n\nBy clicking on the 'Advanced' tab, you have the ability to set all the server\nflags that are available in Appium. This is for advanced users and should only\nbe modified after consulting the Appium documentation.\n\n#### Server presets\n\n![Server presets](docs/images/screen-start-presets.png)\n\nIf you use the advanced server options, you have the ability to save\na configuration for later use. Simply save the preset on the 'Advanced' tab,\nand you will subsequently be able to recall and start the server with that\nconfiguration from the 'Preset' tab.\n\n### The server console output window\n\nOnce you start the server, it will launch on the host and port you specified,\nand open a new window displaying the server log output.\n\n![Server console](docs/images/screen-logs.png)\n\nThis is fairly straightforward and no real interaction is possible, beyond\nusing the button to stop the server. You can also copy-and-paste the logs from\nthis window which is useful in reporting Appium issues.\n\n## Reporting Issues and Requesting Features\n\nAppium Desktop is open source, and we use GitHub for issue tracking. Please\nsimply report issues at our [issue\ntracker](https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/issues). We will endeavor to\ndetermine whether the issue you are reporting is related to Appium Desktop or\nAppium Server. If it's not related to Appium Desktop specifically, we will\nclose the issue and ask you to open a general Appium issue at [Appium's main\nissue tracker](https://github.com/appium/appium/issues). Please, save\nyourselves and us valuable time by getting clear on whether the issue you're\nexperiencing is related to Appium Desktop specifically or instead is a general\nAppium issue. You can do this by seeing whether the issue reproduces with the\nAppium command line server as well. If it does, direct your report to Appium's\nissue tracker.\n\nHave a feature request? Follow the same process and submit an issue to the\nappropriate tracker! (Either here in this repo if the request is specifically\nfor Appium Desktop, or Appium's main tracker if the request is for Appium more\ngenerally.)\n\n## Advanced Topics and Troubleshooting\n\n#### Appium can't detect environment variables on Mac\n\nAppium uses environment variables like `ANDROID_HOME` as well as relying on\nvarious binaries in your `PATH` and so on. When running from the command line\nin an environment where you have set these variables appropriately, Appium has\nno problem in picking them up. However, Appium Desktop does not run in a shell\nor a command-line environment, and so by default it does not have access to\nenvironment variables you have set in your shell startup script or profile. To\nwork around this, we use the\n[shell-env](https://github.com/sindresorhus/shell-env) package to pick up\nenvironment variables defined in your shell. This package only looks in certain\ncommon init scripts, however, like `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, and\n`~/.zshrc`. If you set your Appium environment variables in some other way, you\nwill need to create one of these default init scripts and set your environment\nvariables there as well, so that Appium Desktop will successfully pick them up.\n\n#### Warnings about being on a read-only file system\n\nThis probably means you tried to launch Appium Desktop from the downloaded disk\nimage (`.dmg` file). This is not a supported mode of running Appium Desktop. To\ncorrectly install Appium Desktop, copy the application from the disk image to\nyour local filesystem, to somewhere like `/Applications`. Then, run the app\nfrom that new location.\n\n## Developer Instructions\n\nWant to hack on Appium Desktop? Awesome!
