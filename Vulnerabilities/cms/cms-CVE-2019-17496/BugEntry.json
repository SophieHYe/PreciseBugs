([#2513](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2513))\n- Lightswitch fields that don\u2019t have a value yet will now be assigned the default field value, even for existing elements. ([#2404](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2404))\n- The system installer now sets the initial admin account\u2019s preferred language to the site language selected in the installation wizard. ([#2480](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2480))\n- Table fields now have \u201cMin Rows\u201d, \u201cMax Rows\u201d, and \u201cAdd Row Label\u201d settings. ([#2372](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2372))\n- Table fields now have \u201cDate\u201d, \u201cTime\u201d, \u201cLightswitch\u201d, and \u201cColor\u201d column type options.\n- Color fields now return a `craft\\fields\\data\\ColorData` object, with `hex`, `rgb`, `red`, `green`, `blue`, `r`, `g`, `b`, and `luma` properties.\n- Matrix fields now have \u201cManage blocks on a per-site basis\u201d, \u201cMin Blocks\u201d, and \u201cMax Blocks\u201d settings.\n- Matrix fields with only one block type, and equal values for the Min Blocks and Max Blocks settings, now hide the UI for adding and deleting blocks.\n- Matrix fields with only one block type will now auto-create the minimum number of blocks required by the field, per the Min Blocks setting, for new elements. ([#850](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/850))\n- The `migrate/up` console command will now update the appropriate schema version in the database after successfully completing all migrations. ([#1907](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1907))\n- Users can now set their preferred language to any supported application language. ([#847](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/847))\n- Users are no longer logged out when verifying a new email address on their own account. ([#1421](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1421))\n- Users no longer get an exception or error message if they click on an invalid/expired email verification link and are already logged in. Instead they\u2019ll be redirected to wherever they would normally be taken immediately after logging in. ([#1422](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1422))\n- If anything prevents a user from being deleted, any changes that were made in preparation for deleting the user are now rolled back.\n- Added `webp` as a web-safe image format.\n- Craft now checks if the current installation can manipulate an image instead of checking against a predefined list. ([#1648](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1648), [#1545](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1545))\n- The `getCsrfInput()` global function has been renamed to `csrfInput()`. (getCsrfInput() still works but produces a deprecation error.)\n- The `{% cache %}` tag no longer includes the query string when storing the cache URL.\n- Added the `|timestamp` Twig filter, for formatting a date as a user-friendly timestamp.\n- Added the `|datetime` Twig filter, for formatting a date with a localized date+time format.\n- Added the `|time` Twig filter, for formatting a date with a localized time format.\n- Added the `|multisort` Twig filter, which duplicates an array and sorts it with [craft\\helpers\\ArrayHelper::multisort()](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/yii-helpers-basearrayhelper.html#multisort()-detail).\n- Added the `|atom` and `|rss` Twig filters, for formatting dates in Atom and RSS date formats, respectively.\n- Added the `|column` Twig filter, for capturing the key/property values of a series of arrays/objects.\n- Added the `|index` Twig filter, for indexing an array of arrays/objects by one of their keys/values.\n- Added the `|filterByValue` Twig filter.\n- Added the `|duration` Twig filter, which converts a `DateInterval` object into a human-readable duration.\n- The `t` filter now always defaults to translating the given string using the `site` category unless it is otherwise specified (e.g. `myString|t('pluginhandle')`).\n- The `|date` filter can be passed `'short'`, `'medium'`, `'long'`, and `'full'`, which will format the date with a localized date format.\n- It is now possibly to customize the SQL of [element queries](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/element-queries.html), and there are more choices on how the data should be returned.\n- Element queries are no longer limited to 100 results by default.\n- The \u201cFailed\u201d message in the queue HUD in the Control Panel now shows the full error message as alt text. ([#855](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/855))\n- Added the `convertFilenamesToAscii` config setting.\n- Added the `preserveExifData` config setting, `false` by default and requires Imagick. ([#2034](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/2034))\n- Added the `aliases` config setting, providing an easy way to define custom [aliases](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-concept-aliases.html).\n- Removed support for automatically determining the values for the `omitScriptNameInUrls` and `usePathInfo` config settings.\n- It\u2019s now possible to override Craft\u2019s application config via `config/app.php`.\n- It\u2019s now possible to override volume settings via `config/volumes.php`.\n- It\u2019s now possible to override all plugins\u2019 settings via `config/<plugin-handle>.php`.\n- Renamed the `runTasksAutomatically` config setting to `runQueueAutomatically`.\n- The `translationDebugOutput` config setting will now wrap strings with `@` characters if the category is `app`, `$` if the category is `site`, and `%` for anything else.\n- All user-defined strings in the Control Panel (e.g. section names) are now translated using the `site` category, to prevent translation conflicts with Craft\u2019s own Control Panel translations.\n- Routes can now be stored on a per-site basis, rather than per-locale.\n- Web requests are now logged to `storage/logs/web.log`.\n- Web requests that result in 404 errors are now logged to `storage/logs/web-404s.log`.\n- Console requests are now logged to `storage/logs/console.log`.\n- Queue requests are now logged to `storage/logs/queue.log`.\n- Craft 3 now requires PHP 7.0.0 or later.\n- Craft 3 now requires MySQL 5.5+ or PostgreSQL 9.5+.\n- Craft now takes advantage of the [PHP Intl extension](http://php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php) when available.\n- Craft now uses Stringy for better string processing support.\n- Craft now uses Flysystem for better asset volume support.\n- Craft now uses Swiftmailer for better email sending support.\n- Craft now uses the [Yii 2 Queue Extension](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-queue) for managing background tasks.\n- Craft now uses the Zend Feed library for better RSS and Atom processing support.\n- Updated Yii to 2.0.15.1.\n- Updated Twig to 2.4.\n- Updated Guzzle to 6.3.\n\n### Deprecated\n- Many things have been deprecated. See [Changes in Craft 3](https://docs.craftcms.com/v3/changes-in-craft-3.html) for a complete list.\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed a bug where a PHP session would be started on every template rendering request whether it was needed or not. ([#1765](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/1765))\n\n### Security\n- Craft uses OpenSSL for encryption rather than mcrypt, which is far more secure and well-maintained.\n", "/*!   - 2019-09-25 */\n(function($){\n\n/** global: Craft */\n/** global: Garnish */\n// Set all the standard Craft.* stuff\n$.extend(Craft,\n    {\n        navHeight: 48,\n\n        /**\n         * Get a translated message.\n         *\n         * @param {string} category\n         * @param {string} message\n         * @param {object} params\n         * @return string\n         */\n        t: function(category, message, params) {\n            if (\n                typeof Craft.translations[category] !== 'undefined' &&\n                typeof Craft.translations[category][message] !== 'undefined'\n            ) {\n                message = Craft.translations[category][message];\n            }\n\n            if (params) {\n                for (var key in params) {\n                    if (!params.hasOwnProperty(key)) {\n                        continue;\n                    }\n\n                    message = message.replace('{' + key + '}', params[key]);\n                }\n            }\n\n            return message;\n        },\n\n        formatDate: function(date) {\n            if (typeof date !== 'object') {\n                date = new Date(date);\n            }\n\n            return $.datepicker.formatDate(Craft.datepickerOptions.dateFormat, date);\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * Formats a number.\n         *\n         * @param {string} number\n         * @return string D3 format\n         */\n        formatNumber: function(number, format) {\n            if(typeof format == 'undefined') {\n                format = ',.0f';\n            }\n\n            var formatter = d3.formatLocale(d3FormatLocaleDefinition).format(format);\n\n            return formatter(number);\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * Escapes some HTML.\n         *\n         * @param {string} str\n         * @return string\n         */\n        escapeHtml: function(str) {\n            return $('<div/>').text(str).html();\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * Escapes special regular expression characters.\n         *\n         * @param {string} str\n         * @return string\n         */\n        escapeRegex: function(str) {\n            // h/t https://stackoverflow.com/a/9310752\n            return str.replace(/[-[\\]{}()*+?.,\\\\^$|#\\s]/g, '\\\\$&');\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * Returns the text in a string that might contain HTML tags.\n         *\n         * @param {string} str\n         * @return string\n         */\n        getText: function(str) {\n            return $('<div/>').html(str).text();\n        },\n\n        /**\n         * Encodes a URI copmonent.
