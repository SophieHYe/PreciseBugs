If you don't want to use such file any more (and you have\n        one), you will have to delete or rename it by hand!\n\n        Also please note, that user stylesheet selectors like\n\n            .selector {\n                background-image: url(img/example.jpg);\n            }\n\n        now need to use the {TEMPLATE_PATH} like\n\n            .selector {\n                background-image: url({TEMPLATE_PATH}img/example.jpg);\n            }\n\n        Content of a user.css will always be put LAST into the combined\n        CSS, this means it will override any possible plugin output.\n        If a user.css file does not exist in your own template directory,\n        but inside the default 2k11 template directory, this will always\n        be used (this behaviour is called \"default fallback chain\").\n\n    * Use https URLs for Atom feed, if called through HTTPS (hboeck)\n\n    * Restore the \"Show toolbar within media selector popup?\" option,\n      it was ignored before.\n\n    * Fix Issue #321, negative offset for LIMIT SQL statements when\n      using stable archive sorting and plugins like history.\n\n    * Templatechooser will not apply theme in backend admin.\n\n    * Use \"secure\" flag for (session) cookies sent over SSL, thanks to\n      dayton967\n\n    * Make preview_iframe.tpl template files load the proper frontend\n      CSS file, including cache-busting version string when changing\n      themes\n\n    * Implement patch to properly initiate templates_c on installation\n      for shared installs (thanks to fugue88)\n\n    * Allow templatechooser plugin to read a custom \"blacklist.txt\"\n      within its directory, that can blacklist certain themes from\n      being selected.\n\n    * Allow serendipity_setCookie() function to set custom expiry.\n\n    * Adapt .htaccess profile of \"mod_rewrite for 1&1 and problematic\n      servers\" to not include the \"Options -MultiViews\" option, since\n      this is often blocked\n\n    * Fix initializing smarty framework in the preview/saving iframe,\n      so that a template's config.inc.php is always loaded.\n\n    * Show debugging .tpl file information with relative directory only\n\n    * fix wrong upgrade removal of dead files with 2.0.1 update\n\n\nVersion 2.0.1 (March 12th, 2015)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Fix missing escaping (possible XSS) of category names in the\n      Backend Entry Admin, which would allow editors that create a\n      forged category name to attack other editors in the backend\n      (privileged access to the backend required). Thanks a lot to Edric\n      Teo for reporting this issue.\n\n    * Improved detection for possible upgrade/plugin/PHP errors. A\n      warning will be emitted on the dashboard, when the Serendipity\n      JavaScript library could not be loaded.\n\n    * syndication fix: use absolute urls for subtome\n\n    * Issue 306: localStorage may be deactivated by setting a config\n      option or using security-related extensions at least in some\n      browsers, which might (at least in FF) break backend JS\n      functionality. Added extra tests to 2k11 backend JS.\n\n      If you use localStorage, please test if it is actually available\n      by testing if localStorage !== null in JS.\n\n    * Issue 280: Allow every theme to utilize a \"user.css\" file that\n      gets loaded on top of the frontend (or backend, if in admin/\n      subdirectory) theme. This file can be used for customized CSS of\n      a blog-admin which carries over to future Serendipity updates\n\n    * Issue 299: Do not display dashboard for users with no permission\n      to perform actions in the backend (frontend-users)\n\n    * Make \"rewriteURL\" smarty modifier available to do a\n      {$CONST.PATH_ARCHIVE|rewriteURL} within a smarty template file.\n\n    * Add a generic odd/even for backend dashboard widgets to align\n      properly. Future dashboard widgets need to get the new extra\n      class dashboard widget on the section element they create.\n\n    * Fix event emoticate plugin to reflect proper call usage of\n      serendipity_getTemplateFile(), if a theme uses custom emoticons.\n      UPDATE your themes emoticons.inc.php file, if have.

Improved serendipity.tagsList exit if freetag plugin\n      is not installed.\n\n    * Minor backend UI fixes (taxonomy quick view in entry editor,\n     'Done' msg emitted by Bayes plugin)\n\n    * Clearer language constants for entries in dashboard, labelled\n      \"In progress\"\n\n\nVersion 2.0 (January 23rd, 2015)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Smarty fix for purging compiled files\n\n    * Fix wrong search page ordering when stable archive was active\n\n    * Prevent entryproperties from saving/displaying a browser-side\n      stored password that was actually not set.\n\n    * Stronger check for existing logger interface to prevent errors\n      when it is not actively used.\n\n    * Fix entryproperties being removed when publishing an article\n      from the dashboard and by specific plugins (freetag, trackback)\n      that modify entry data.\n\n    * Fix deleting comments when user is not an admin, but the entry\n      belongs to him. Thanks to berberic.\n\n    * Patch PEAR.php to use \"static\" isError declaration to prevent\n      PHP error messages\n\n    * Change order of IF-statements in entries.tpl to check for\n      comment_moderate/comment_added, to properly emit the message\n      whether a comment is being moderated.\n\n    * Fix searching for entries in the admin panel with database\n      types other than \"mysql\"\n\n    * Change entry editor's category assignment to toggle between\n      a hierarchical and a plain list (good for many categories)\n\n    * Fix date formatting in entry editor to not use ISO year\n      but the calendar year\n\n    * Fix autoupdate version read and transmit\n\n\nVersion 2.0-rc2 (December 23rd, 2014)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Fixes escaping of comments in the new backend pane to prevent\n      XSS. Thanks to Steffen R\u9439mann for reporting!\n\n    * Fix wrong parameter count in serendipity_entity_decode\n\n\nVersion 2.0-rc1 (includes beta4/5/6) (December 19th, 2014)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * entryproperties plugin will now automatically disable nl2br\n      markup, when the WYSIWYG editor is used to create en entry\n\n    * PHP Requirement now is at: PHP 5.3+\n\n    * Fix for syndication subtome onclick handler\n\n    * Fix problematic preview stylesheet reference\n\n    * Optimized clearing smarty template files on upgrading\n\n    * Properly reset the \"disable markup\" feature of entryproperties\n      plugin when none selected\n\n    * PHP 5.4+ fix to properly call htmlspecialchars() / htmlentities() /\n      html_entity_decode() with a charset option, that has been\n      set to to default to UTF-8 and will yield empty strings when\n      being used in NON-UTF-8 environments. Now we utilize a\n      serendipity_specialchars() wrapper call.\n\n    * Added SQLite3 OO database layer for PHP 5.4+\n\n    * New personal preference to choose CKEditor toolbar presets.\n      Presets can be overwritte through a\n      templates/xxx/admin/ckeditor_custom_config.js if needed.\n      See htmlarea/ckeditor_s9y_config.js for details.\n\n    * Proof of concept templates \"default-php\" and \"default-xml\" have\n      been moved to Siber...Spartacus. They would need adapting to\n      Serendipity 2.0 (simple methods like getConfigDir() et al),\n      but since those Template APIs have virtually zero usage scenario,\n      they remain experimental.\n\n    * Added new PAT_JS mod_rewrite rule to .htaccess files\n\n    * Removed experimental support for PHP/SMARTY IN-MEMORY caching\n      added in 2.0-beta3, since this could not work.\n\n    * Smarty 3.1.21 upgrade (see changelog)\n\n    * Fix ImageMagick new sizing issues while forcing image geometry\n      exactly to given sizes with imageselectorplus\n\n    * Fix issue #220 with pdf directory moving rename() error\n\n    * Fix bug in entry listing, which showed wrong categories for\n      entries (Issue #201)\n\n    * Improve RegExp for Feed-URL matching, thanks to fugue88\n\n    * Proper SQLite PDO filenames in shared installations (Issue #214)\n\n    * ImageMagick now can get parameters to generate thumbnails,\n      see serendipity_config.inc.php for example values\n\n    * Allow to enable/disable the new autosave feature in personal\n      preferences (Issue #213)\n\n    * Re-added installer test for writable serendipity base directory\n\n\nVersion 2.0-beta3 (July 25th, 2014)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Move admin/media_showitem.tpl to theme's directory in 2k11. With\n      an adaptation in serendipity_admin_image_selector.php, this now is\n      a \"true\" frontend template which uses the styles of the frontend\n      theme. Theme authors might want to adapt it to their themes.\n\n    * Moved general syndication plugin option into the core\n\n    * Smarty 3.1.19 upgrade (see changelog)\n\n    * Fixed thumbnail recreation, Issue #134\n\n    * Merged external JS libraries into a central \"plugins.js\" of the 2k11\n      backend template, can be updated through\n      templates/2k11/admin/js/gruntipity.php helper script.\n\n    * Adapted database table structure change for statistics, shoutbox,\n      karma and spamblock plugin (for new field definition of \"ip\" field)\n      Thanks to rohdef!\n\n    * Added new option \"enabledBackendPopups\" that allow to specify\n      if inline modal dialogs or popups are used in the backend for\n      e.g. the category selectory and media library\n\n    * added experimental support for PHP/SMARTY IN MEMORY caching\n      Enabled by default, if classes found loaded.\n      Disable with\n        $serendipity['disable_apc'] = true;\n      and\n        $serendipity['disable_memcache'] = true;\n\n    * Support added in serendipity_db_schema_import for sqlite\n      autoincrement\n\n    * Remove Google Reader button from syndication plugin options\n\n    * Add subToMe-button to syndication plugin and change its defaults\n\n    * Use Browsercache to save cache and restore entries\n\n    * Improved installer to forbid using database table prefixes with\n      special characters\n\n    * Themes using Engines are now able to use the parent's\n      configuration\n\n    * Prevent \"new\" plugin api to install double instances of plugins\n      that are not stackable (issue #45)\n\n    * Back button in plugin-config\n\n    * Adapted serendipity_editor.js to provide more global (though\n      deprecated) API access methods for plugins like amazonchooser\n      and linktrimmer, to perform insertion. Also fixed the\n      insertion of text when the ID of the element is not prefixed\n\n    * Move sort by name to simple filter in ML, replace file extension\n\n    * Remember selected media library folder\n\n    * Show upload-success or error with the ajax image uploader\n\n    * Fix preview entry exception (issue #119)\n\n    * Add serendipity.toggle_collapsible as a reusable JS function\n      for the core backend and backend sections emitted by plugins as\n      an easy way to provide show/hide functionality. (yellowled)\n\n    * Fixed media insert target bug (issued by #143, #145, #121)\n\n    * Fixed publish drafted-entries via dashboard (issue #160)\n\n    * All frontend themes that rely on the bundled Core jQuery library\n      are currently using the jquery.noConflict-mode for compatibility\n      to older plugins.\n      This mode is now considered deprecated and will be removed in\n      future releases. A new variable:\n        $serendipity['capabilities']['jquery-noconflict'] = false;\n      in your theme's config.inc.php file can now turn of that\n      noConflict-mode.\n\n    * Due to distinction of backend and frontend themes, each theme\n      that provides a custom jquery.js now only does so for the\n      frontend. The backend now listens to a:\n\n        $serendipity['capabilities']['jquery_backend'] = false;\n\n      variable, and the file needs to be jquery_backend.js that\n      a backend theme would reference to.\n\n    * Changed 2k11's config.inc.php file to provide a more stable\n      call of event hooks so that other themes can also hook\n      their own events.\n\n    * Changed JS for category filtering and its reset button to be a\n      reusable function, which is now also used in the list of\n      installable plugins.\n\n    * Fixed wrong local documentation URL in plugin configuration\n\n    * Added new \"backend_dashboard\" event-hook for plugins to use\n      within dashboard.\n\n    * Backend and Frontend themes can now be set independently from\n      each other. New backend themes now need to set:\n\n        Backend: Yes\n\n      in their info.txt file. If you adapt a custom admin theme,\n      ensure that it is compatible to the new \"2k11\" backend to\n      ensure proper future usage within Serendipity. The bulletproof\n      backend will now no longer be recognized as a backend theme\n      option, but can be selected as a new frontend theme, while\n      using 2k11 (=default) in the backend.\n\n    * Include klogger, call it as $serendipity['logger']->debug/error.\n      The log-level can be set in the general configuration and is\n      disabled by default.\n\n    * Fixed missing s9ymdb ID\n\n    * Add HTTP_Request2 and dependencies as bundled libraries and\n      update PEAR library to version 1.9.4\n\n    * Implemented AJAX uploadResize option to allow resizing an image\n      before upload (onli)\n\n    * Improved file/directory removal code to (hopefully) fail more\n      gracefully\n\n    * Change \"default\" admin backend template fallback chain so that\n      old admin themes can theoretically be shown with the \"old\"\n      admin interface. This however in many themes breaks the\n      Serendipity workflow. In other words, currently old custom backend\n      themes are deprecated. We are still working on how to deal\n      with this and if we can add some sort of compatibility or port.\n\n    * Fix bundled jquery's source mapping, upgraded to 1.11.1\n\n    * Fixed missing media name in resize GET URL\n\n    * Fix MediaDB overlay display\n\n    * Re-Added possibility to change filename/target directory for\n      media uploads\n\n    * Update CKEditor to 4.4\n\n    * Fixed some missing internationalization instances\n\n    * Minor CSS improvements for upgrader, plugin sequencing widget\n\n    * RSS importer accepts pubDate in addition to pubdate element.\n\n    * Upgrader in Dashboard can be disabled, returns error message when\n      URL not accessible\n\n    * Added a category filtering ability for the entry editor\n\n    * Better check when removing old/dead files to prevent error\n      messages\n\n    * WYSIWYG editor respects image floats\n\n    * Support html5 multiple file upload\n\n    * Modernizr, magnificPopup updates\n\n    * Improvements to equal heights js, button labels\n\n    * No longer truncate long entry titles\n\n    * Improve non-WYSIWYG editor tag insertion, url insertion\n\n    * Improve less DOM firing on certain javascript tasks\n\n    * Introduce js_backend event hook\n\n\nVersion 2.0-beta1 and followup -beta2 (April 14th, 2014)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Upgrade Smarty libs to 3.1.18\n\n    * Automatic upgrade removal of old Smarty2 files (2.0-alpha2)\n      function uses SPL\n\n    * Implemented patch https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/pull/15\n\n    * When switching Themes, both the backend and the frontend\n      will remember the timestamp of the last theme change,\n      to make sure that the browser will not cache a mismatching CSS.\n\n    * Fix theme change issues with global template vars in core\n      (1559472ca3) see 'temporary added empty $template_config_groups'\n      in 1.7-rc2 (eb77dc369a)\n\n    * Use Smarty for backend display output\n\n    * \"Themes\" are now what has previously been mixed as \"Design\",\n      \"Theme\", \"Template\" or \"Layouts\".\n\n    * WYSIWYG-Spawn-API reworked (2k11/admin/wysiwyg_init.tpl)\n\n    * All Javascript-functions like SetCookie now reside in a\n      serendipity-object, simulating a namespace.\n        SetCookie(...)\n      became\n        serendipity.SetCookie(...)\n\n    * Renamed JS-Function:\n        toggleCategorySelector became toggle_category_selector\n\n    * The advanced js option (eyecandy) got removed, as such a thing\n      like advanced js doesn't exist anymore\n\n    * dashboard_plugin has an equivalent in the core, replacing the\n      frontpage\n\n    * Constants like S9Y_FRAMEWORK_COMPAT are no longer set\n      (include_once is used instead)\n\n    * New additional option to render smarty-functions:\n      serendipity_smarty_show($template, $data)\n\n    * A number of functions now returns their result instead of echoing\n      them (TODO: a bunch of image- and\n      trackback-functions still use echo for messages\"):\n        serendipity_plugin_config\n        serendipity_printEntryForm\n        serendipity_printEntries\n        function serendipity_showMedia\n        serendipity_showPropertyForm\n        showMediaLibrary\n        serendipity_guessInput\n        memSnap\n        serendipity_displayTopUrlList\n        serendipity_displayTopExits\n        serendipity_displayTopReferrers\n        serendipity_printConfigTemplate\n        show_plugins\n\n    * Functions removed from the core:\n        serendipity_printConfigJS\n\n    * Functions added to the core:\n        serendipity_generateImageSelectorParams\n\n    * All internal plugins got extracted from plugin_internal.inc.php\n      and moved to plugins/.\n      They are renamed to work there (upgrader task provides migration):\n        serendipity_calendar_plugin    became serendipity_plugin_calendar\n        serendipity_quicksearch_plugin became serendipity_plugin_quicksearch\n        serendipity_archives_plugin    became serendipity_plugin_archives\n        serendipity_categories_plugin  became serendipity_plugin_categories\n        serendipity_syndication_plugin became serendipity_plugin_syndication\n        serendipity_superuser_plugin   became serendipity_plugin_superuser\n        serendipity_plug_plugin        became serendipity_plugin_plug\n\n    * Add plugin hook \"js\", generating a virtual serendipity.js\n\n    * Admin JS is now bundled in serendipity_editor.js.tpl and\n      rendered using smarty in the theme config\n\n    * Admin JS got rewritten using jQuery where applicable\n\n    * serendipity_define.js.php removed\n\n    * Removed support for layout.php\n\n    * The whole PHP-Code now almost never echoes integrated HTML, but\n      uses smarty template (TODO: Remove the almost)\n      The necessary smarty-templates reside in 2k11/admin/\n      Every theme can generate its own backend if it integrates those\n      templates under admin/ itself\n\n    * 2k11 is set as the new default backend, replacing bulletproof.\n      default remains the fallback so far.\n\n    * A number of functions had some arguments removed:\n        * function serendipity_displayImageList:\n            From\n                function serendipity_displayImageList($page = 0, $lineBreak = NULL, $manage = false, $url = NULL, $show_upload = false, $limit_path = NULL, $smarty_display = true)\n            to\n                function serendipity_displayImageList($page = 0, $lineBreak = NULL, $manage = false, $url = NULL, $show_upload = false, $limit_path = NULL)\n        * function serendipity_showMedia\n            From\n                function serendipity_showMedia(&$file, &$paths, $url = '', $manage = false, $lineBreak = 3, $enclose = true, $smarty_vars = array(), $smarty_display = true)\n            to\n                function serendipity_showMedia(&$file, &$paths, $url = '', $manage = false, $lineBreak = 3, $enclose = true, $smarty_vars = array())\n        * generate_plugins\n            From\n                static function generate_plugins($side, $tag = '', $negate = false, $class = null, $id = null, $tpl = 'sidebar.tpl')\n            to\n                static function generate_plugins($side, $negate = false, $class = null, $id = null, $tpl = 'sidebar.tpl')\n\n    * serendipity_showMedia now no longer

Please refer to your ISP about this.\n\n    * Added new serendipity['defaultBaseURL'] variable that makes sure\n      that the baseURL is not overriden when configuring serendipity\n      with a possibly autodetected currentl URL.

Thanks a lot to Edric\n      Teo for reporting this issue.\n\n    * Improved detection for possible upgrade/plugin/PHP errors. A\n      warning will be emitted on the dashboard, when the Serendipity\n      JavaScript library could not be loaded.\n\n    * syndication fix: use absolute urls for subtome\n\n    * Issue 306: localStorage may be deactivated by setting a config\n      option or using security-related extensions at least in some\n      browsers, which might (at least in FF) break backend JS\n      functionality.

This file can be used for customized CSS of\n      a blog-admin which carries over to future Serendipity updates\n\n    * Issue 299: Do not display dashboard for users with no permission\n      to perform actions in the backend (frontend-users)\n\n    * Make \"rewriteURL\" smarty modifier available to do a\n      {$CONST.PATH_ARCHIVE|rewriteURL} within a smarty template file.\n\n    * Add a generic odd/even for backend dashboard widgets to align\n      properly. Future dashboard widgets need to get the new extra\n      class dashboard widget on the section element they create.\n\n    * Fix event emoticate plugin to reflect proper call usage of\n      serendipity_getTemplateFile(), if a theme uses custom emoticons.\n      UPDATE your themes emoticons.inc.php file, if have.

Improved serendipity.tagsList exit if freetag plugin\n      is not installed.\n\n    * Minor backend UI fixes (taxonomy quick view in entry editor,\n     'Done' msg emitted by Bayes plugin)\n\n    * Clearer language constants for entries in dashboard, labelled\n      \"In progress\"\n\n\nVersion 2.0 (January 23rd, 2015)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Smarty fix for purging compiled files\n\n    * Fix wrong search page ordering when stable archive was active\n\n    * Prevent entryproperties from saving/displaying a browser-side\n      stored password that was actually not set.\n\n    * Stronger check for existing logger interface to prevent errors\n      when it is not actively used.\n\n    * Fix entryproperties being removed when publishing an article\n      from the dashboard and by specific plugins (freetag, trackback)\n      that modify entry data.\n\n    * Fix deleting comments when user is not an admin, but the entry\n      belongs to him.

Thanks to Steffen R\u9439mann for reporting!\n\n    * Fix wrong parameter count in serendipity_entity_decode\n\n\nVersion 2.0-rc1 (includes beta4/5/6) (December 19th, 2014)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * entryproperties plugin will now automatically disable nl2br\n      markup, when the WYSIWYG editor is used to create en entry\n\n    * PHP Requirement now is at: PHP 5.3+\n\n    * Fix for syndication subtome onclick handler\n\n    * Fix problematic preview stylesheet reference\n\n    * Optimized clearing smarty template files on upgrading\n\n    * Properly reset the \"disable markup\" feature of entryproperties\n      plugin when none selected\n\n    * PHP 5.4+ fix to properly call htmlspecialchars() / htmlentities() /\n      html_entity_decode() with a charset option, that has been\n      set to to default to UTF-8 and will yield empty strings when\n      being used in NON-UTF-8 environments. Now we utilize a\n      serendipity_specialchars() wrapper call.\n\n    * Added SQLite3 OO database layer for PHP 5.4+\n\n    * New personal preference to choose CKEditor toolbar presets.\n      Presets can be overwritte through a\n      templates/xxx/admin/ckeditor_custom_config.js if needed.\n      See htmlarea/ckeditor_s9y_config.js for details.\n\n    * Proof of concept templates \"default-php\" and \"default-xml\" have\n      been moved to Siber...Spartacus. They would need adapting to\n      Serendipity 2.0 (simple methods like getConfigDir() et al),\n      but since those Template APIs have virtually zero usage scenario,\n      they remain experimental.\n\n    * Added new PAT_JS mod_rewrite rule to .htaccess files\n\n    * Removed experimental support for PHP/SMARTY IN-MEMORY caching\n      added in 2.0-beta3, since this could not work.\n\n    * Smarty 3.1.21 upgrade (see changelog)\n\n    * Fix ImageMagick new sizing issues while forcing image geometry\n      exactly to given sizes with imageselectorplus\n\n    * Fix issue #220 with pdf directory moving rename() error\n\n    * Fix bug in entry listing, which showed wrong categories for\n      entries (Issue #201)\n\n    * Improve RegExp for Feed-URL matching, thanks to fugue88\n\n    * Proper SQLite PDO filenames in shared installations (Issue #214)\n\n    * ImageMagick now can get parameters to generate thumbnails,\n      see serendipity_config.inc.php for example values\n\n    * Allow to enable/disable the new autosave feature in personal\n      preferences (Issue #213)\n\n    * Re-added installer test for writable serendipity base directory\n\n\nVersion 2.0-beta3 (July 25th, 2014)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Move admin/media_showitem.tpl to theme's directory in 2k11. With\n      an adaptation in serendipity_admin_image_selector.php, this now is\n      a \"true\" frontend template which uses the styles of the frontend\n      theme. Theme authors might want to adapt it to their themes.\n\n    * Moved general syndication plugin option into the core\n\n    * Smarty 3.1.19 upgrade (see changelog)\n\n    * Fixed thumbnail recreation, Issue #134\n\n    * Merged external JS libraries into a central \"plugins.js\" of the 2k11\n      backend template, can be updated through\n      templates/2k11/admin/js/gruntipity.php helper script.\n\n    * Adapted database table structure change for statistics, shoutbox,\n      karma and spamblock plugin (for new field definition of \"ip\" field)\n      Thanks to rohdef!\n\n    * Added new option \"enabledBackendPopups\" that allow to specify\n      if inline modal dialogs or popups are used in the backend for\n      e.g. the category selectory and media library\n\n    * added experimental support for PHP/SMARTY IN MEMORY caching\n      Enabled by default, if classes found loaded.\n      Disable with\n        $serendipity['disable_apc'] = true;\n      and\n        $serendipity['disable_memcache'] = true;\n\n    * Support added in serendipity_db_schema_import for sqlite\n      autoincrement\n\n    * Remove Google Reader button from syndication plugin options\n\n    * Add subToMe-button to syndication plugin and change its defaults\n\n    * Use Browsercache to save cache and restore entries\n\n    * Improved installer to forbid using database table prefixes with\n      special characters\n\n    * Themes using Engines are now able to use the parent's\n      configuration\n\n    * Prevent \"new\" plugin api to install double instances of plugins\n      that are not stackable (issue #45)\n\n    * Back button in plugin-config\n\n    * Adapted serendipity_editor.js to provide more global (though\n      deprecated) API access methods for plugins like amazonchooser\n      and linktrimmer, to perform insertion. Also fixed the\n      insertion of text when the ID of the element is not prefixed\n\n    * Move sort by name to simple filter in ML, replace file extension\n\n    * Remember selected media library folder\n\n    * Show upload-success or error with the ajax image uploader\n\n    * Fix preview entry exception (issue #119)\n\n    * Add serendipity.toggle_collapsible as a reusable JS function\n      for the core backend and backend sections emitted by plugins as\n      an easy way to provide show/hide functionality. (yellowled)\n\n    * Fixed media insert target bug (issued by #143, #145, #121)\n\n    * Fixed publish drafted-entries via dashboard (issue #160)\n\n    * All frontend themes that rely on the bundled Core jQuery library\n      are currently using the jquery.noConflict-mode for compatibility\n      to older plugins.\n      This mode is now considered deprecated and will be removed in\n      future releases. A new variable:\n        $serendipity['capabilities']['jquery-noconflict'] = false;\n      in your theme's config.inc.php file can now turn of that\n      noConflict-mode.\n\n    * Due to distinction of backend and frontend themes, each theme\n      that provides a custom jquery.js now only does so for the\n      frontend. The backend now listens to a:\n\n        $serendipity['capabilities']['jquery_backend'] = false;\n\n      variable, and the file needs to be jquery_backend.js that\n      a backend theme would reference to.\n\n    * Changed 2k11's config.inc.php file to provide a more stable\n      call of event hooks so that other themes can also hook\n      their own events.\n\n    * Changed JS for category filtering and its reset button to be a\n      reusable function, which is now also used in the list of\n      installable plugins.\n\n    * Fixed wrong local documentation URL in plugin configuration\n\n    * Added new \"backend_dashboard\" event-hook for plugins to use\n      within dashboard.\n\n    * Backend and Frontend themes can now be set independently from\n      each other. New backend themes now need to set:\n\n        Backend: Yes\n\n      in their info.txt file. If you adapt a custom admin theme,\n      ensure that it is compatible to the new \"2k11\" backend to\n      ensure proper future usage within Serendipity. The bulletproof\n      backend will now no longer be recognized as a backend theme\n      option, but can be selected as a new frontend theme, while\n      using 2k11 (=default) in the backend.\n\n    * Include klogger, call it as $serendipity['logger']->debug/error.\n      The log-level can be set in the general configuration and is\n      disabled by default.\n\n    * Fixed missing s9ymdb ID\n\n    * Add HTTP_Request2 and dependencies as bundled libraries and\n      update PEAR library to version 1.9.4\n\n    * Implemented AJAX uploadResize option to allow resizing an image\n      before upload (onli)\n\n    * Improved file/directory removal code to (hopefully) fail more\n      gracefully\n\n    * Change \"default\" admin backend template fallback chain so that\n      old admin themes can theoretically be shown with the \"old\"\n      admin interface. This however in many themes breaks the\n      Serendipity workflow. In other words, currently old custom backend\n      themes are deprecated. We are still working on how to deal\n      with this and if we can add some sort of compatibility or port.\n\n    * Fix bundled jquery's source mapping, upgraded to 1.11.1\n\n    * Fixed missing media name in resize GET URL\n\n    * Fix MediaDB overlay display\n\n    * Re-Added possibility to change filename/target directory for\n      media uploads\n\n    * Update CKEditor to 4.4\n\n    * Fixed some missing internationalization instances\n\n    * Minor CSS improvements for upgrader, plugin sequencing widget\n\n    * RSS importer accepts pubDate in addition to pubdate element.\n\n    * Upgrader in Dashboard can be disabled, returns error message when\n      URL not accessible\n\n    * Added a category filtering ability for the entry editor\n\n    * Better check when removing old/dead files to prevent error\n      messages\n\n    * WYSIWYG editor respects image floats\n\n    * Support html5 multiple file upload\n\n    * Modernizr, magnificPopup updates\n\n    * Improvements to equal heights js, button labels\n\n    * No longer truncate long entry titles\n\n    * Improve non-WYSIWYG editor tag insertion, url insertion\n\n    * Improve less DOM firing on certain javascript tasks\n\n    * Introduce js_backend event hook\n\n\nVersion 2.0-beta1 and followup -beta2 (April 14th, 2014)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Upgrade Smarty libs to 3.1.18\n\n    * Automatic upgrade removal of old Smarty2 files (2.0-alpha2)\n      function uses SPL\n\n    * Implemented patch https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/pull/15\n\n    * When switching Themes, both the backend and the frontend\n      will remember the timestamp of the last theme change,\n      to make sure that the browser will not cache a mismatching CSS.\n\n    * Fix theme change issues with global template vars in core\n      (1559472ca3) see 'temporary added empty $template_config_groups'\n      in 1.7-rc2 (eb77dc369a)\n\n    * Use Smarty for backend display output\n\n    * \"Themes\" are now what has previously been mixed as \"Design\",\n      \"Theme\", \"Template\" or \"Layouts\".\n\n    * WYSIWYG-Spawn-API reworked (2k11/admin/wysiwyg_init.tpl)\n\n    * All Javascript-functions like SetCookie now reside in a\n      serendipity-object, simulating a namespace.\n        SetCookie(...)\n      became\n        serendipity.SetCookie(...)\n\n    * Renamed JS-Function:\n        toggleCategorySelector became toggle_category_selector\n\n    * The advanced js option (eyecandy) got removed, as such a thing\n      like advanced js doesn't exist anymore\n\n    * dashboard_plugin has an equivalent in the core, replacing the\n      frontpage\n\n    * Constants like S9Y_FRAMEWORK_COMPAT are no longer set\n      (include_once is used instead)\n\n    * New additional option to render smarty-functions:\n      serendipity_smarty_show($template, $data)\n\n    * A number of functions now returns their result instead of echoing\n      them (TODO: a bunch of image- and\n      trackback-functions still use echo for messages\"):\n        serendipity_plugin_config\n        serendipity_printEntryForm\n        serendipity_printEntries\n        function serendipity_showMedia\n        serendipity_showPropertyForm\n        showMediaLibrary\n        serendipity_guessInput\n        memSnap\n        serendipity_displayTopUrlList\n        serendipity_displayTopExits\n        serendipity_displayTopReferrers\n

serendipity_generateImageSelectorParams\n\n    * All internal plugins got extracted from plugin_internal.inc.php\n      and moved to plugins/.\n      They are renamed to work there (upgrader task provides migration):\n        serendipity_calendar_plugin    became serendipity_plugin_calendar\n        serendipity_quicksearch_plugin became serendipity_plugin_quicksearch\n

using jQuery where applicable\n\n    * serendipity_define.js.php removed\n\n    * Removed support for layout.php\n\n    * The whole PHP-Code now almost never echoes integrated HTML, but\n      uses smarty template (TODO: Remove the almost)\n      The necessary smarty-templates reside in 2k11/admin/\n      Every theme can generate its own backend if it integrates those\n      templates under admin/ itself\n\n    * 2k11 is set as the new default backend, replacing bulletproof.\n      default remains the fallback so far.\n\n    * A number of functions had some arguments removed:\n        *

returns the used template and\n      echoes the generated HTML, but only returns the generated HTML\n\n    * Themes now have their own configuration page,\n      ?serendipity[adminModule]=templates&serendipity[adminAction]=editConfiguration\n\n    * jQuery in the backend no longer runs in noConflict-mode. Use\n      $(...) instead of jQuery(...)\n\n    * The entryproperty-plugin will now always delete its cache on\n      uninstall, not only if the cache is activated then\n\n    * serendipity_is_iframe now really only checks for iframe and\n      doesn't also echo it\n\n    * Added option simpleFilters (meant to indicate to show less\n      filters and poweruser-options)\n\n    * serendipity_admin_image_selector.php no longer used by 2k11,\n      instead the media library (with admin/media_choose.tpl,\n      admin/media_upload.tpl, media_pane.tpl, media_items.tpl)\n      can generat the imageselector on its own. The editor calls\n      serendipity_admin.php?serendipity[adminModule]=media instead,\n      with serendipity[textarea] indicating the target, and\n      serendipity[showMediaToolbar] activating the imageSelector modus\n\n    * New required PHP-Version: 5.3 or higher (checked in the installer)\n\n\nVersion 1.7.8 (February 9th, 2014)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Fixed POST for db entry insert, caused by 1.7.6 security feature\n\n\nVersion 1.7.7 (February 6th, 2014)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Fixed PHP parse error in templatechooser plugin.

Thereafter, the same instance is handed back.\n      To overwrite use $serendipity['smarty'] = new Serendipity_Smarty; to create a new instance.\n\n    * Set a global Serendipity errorToExceptionHandler (ophian)\n      changed some old smarty trigger_errors to PHPs native function\n\n    * Updated spamblock plugin (ophian)\n      changed wordfilter to function and Commenters moderation check verify_once\n      to get checked via wordfilter to reject known spam comments before\n\n    * Changed backend comment (error) messages  (ophian)\n      as now captured and styleable messages\n      (newly added .serendipity_backend_msg_notice css class)\n\n    * Updated nl2br plugin (ophian)\n      added isolation tag using nl to br\n      this also adds some NoBR buttons to backend entry forms\n\n    * Smarty3 support (ophian)\n      with this upgrade Serendipity / Smarty will at least need a webserver running the PHP 5.2 series.\n      As of August 2011, all PHP users should note, that the PHP 5.2 series is NOT supported anymore by the PHP developers.\n      All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to PHP 5.3.8 and up. Please refer to your ISP about this.\n\n    * Added new serendipity['defaultBaseURL'] variable that makes sure\n      that the baseURL is not overriden when configuring serendipity\n      with a possibly autodetected currentl URL.
