{"buggy_code": ["# Release 2.7.0\n\n<INSERT SMALL BLURB ABOUT RELEASE FOCUS AREA AND POTENTIAL TOOLCHAIN CHANGES>\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * The methods `Model.fit()`, `Model.predict()`, and `Model.evaluate()` will\n    no longer uprank input data of shape `(batch_size,)`\n    to become `(batch_size, 1)`. This enables `Model` subclasses to process\n    scalar data in their `train_step()`/`test_step()`/`predict_step()` methods.\n    Note that this change may break certain subclassed models.\n    You can revert back to the previous behavior by adding upranking yourself\n    in the `train_step()`/`test_step()`/`predict_step()` methods, e.g.\n    `if x.shape.rank == 1: x = tf.expand_dims(x, axis=-1)`.\n    Functional models as well as Sequential models built with an explicit\n    input shape are not affected.\n  * The methods `Model.to_yaml()` and `keras.models.model_from_yaml` have been\n    replaced to raise a `RuntimeError` as they can be abused to cause arbitrary\n    code execution. It is recommended to use JSON serialization instead of YAML,\n    or, a better alternative, serialize to H5.\n  * `LinearModel` and `WideDeepModel` are moved to the\n    `tf.compat.v1.keras.models.`\n    namespace (`tf.compat.v1.keras.models.LinearModel`\n    and `tf.compat.v1.keras.models.WideDeepModel`),\n    and their `experimental` endpoints\n    (`tf.keras.experimental.models.LinearModel` and\n    `tf.keras.experimental.models.WideDeepModel`) are being deprecated.\n  * RNG behavior change for all `tf.keras.initializers` classes. For any class\n    constructed with a fixed seed, it will no longer generate same value\n    when invoked multiple times. Instead, it will return different value, but a\n    determinisitic sequence. This change will make the initialize behavior align\n    between v1 and v2.\n\n* `tf.lite`:\n  * Rename fields `SignatureDef` table in schema to maximize the parity with\n    TF SavedModel's Signature concept.\n  * Deprecate Makefile builds. Makefile users need to migrate their builds to\n    CMake or Bazel. Please refer to the\n    [Build TensorFlow Lite with CMake](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_cmake)\n    and [Build TensorFlow Lite for ARM boards](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_arm)\n    for the migration.\n  * Deprecate tflite::OpResolver::GetDelegates and the list returned by TfLite's\n    BuiltinOpResolver::GetDelegates is now always empty. Instead, recommend\n    using new method tflite::OpResolver::GetDelegateCreators in order to achieve\n    lazy initialization on TfLite delegate instances.\n\n* TF Core:\n    *   `tf.Graph.get_name_scope()` now always returns a string, as documented.\n        Previously, when called within `name_scope(\"\")` or `name_scope(None)`\n        contexts, it returned None; now it returns the empty string.\n    *   `tensorflow/core/ir/` contains a new MLIR-based Graph dialect that is\n        isomorphic to GraphDef and will be used to replace GraphDef-based (e.g.,\n        Grappler) optimizations.\n    *   Deprecated and removed attrs() function in shape inference. All\n        attributes should be queried by name now (rather than range returned)\n        to enable changing the underlying storage there.\n    *   The following Python symbols were accidentally added in earlier versions\n        of TensorFlow and now are removed. Each symbol has a replacement that\n        should be used instead, but note the replacement's argument names are\n        different.\n        * `tf.quantize_and_dequantize_v4` (accidentally introduced in TensorFlow\n        2.4): Use `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2` instead.\n        * `tf.batch_mat_mul_v3` (accidentally introduced in TensorFlow 2.6): Use\n        `tf.linalg.matmul` instead.\n        * `tf.sparse_segment_sum_grad` (accidentally introduced in TensorFlow\n        2.6): Use `tf.raw_ops.SparseSegmentSumGrad` instead. Directly calling\n        this op is typically not necessary, as it is automatically used when\n        computing the gradient of `tf.sparse.segment_sum`.\n    *   Renaming of tensorflow::int64 to int_64_t in numerous places (the former\n        is an alias for the latter) which could result in needing to regenerate\n        selective op registration headers else execution would fail with\n        unregistered kernels error.\n\n## Known Caveats\n\n*<CAVEATS REGARDING THE RELEASE (BUT NOT BREAKING CHANGES).>\n*<ADDING/BUMPING DEPENDENCIES SHOULD GO HERE>\n*<KNOWN LACK OF SUPPORT ON SOME PLATFORM, SHOULD GO HERE>\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* Improvements to the TensorFlow debugging experience:\n  * Previously, TensorFlow error stack traces involved many internal frames,\n    which could be challenging to read through,\n    while not being actionable for end users.\n    As of TF 2.7, TensorFlow filters internal frames in most errors that it\n    raises, to keep stack traces short, readable, and focused on what's\n    actionable for end users (their own code).\n\n    This behavior can be disabled by calling\n    `tf.debugging.disable_traceback_filtering()`, and can be re-enabled via\n    `tf.debugging.enable_traceback_filtering()`. If you are debugging a\n    TensorFlow-internal issue (e.g. to prepare a TensorFlow PR), make sure\n    to disable traceback filtering. You can check whether this feature is\n    currently enabled by calling\n    `tf.debugging.is_traceback_filtering_enabled()`.\n\n    Note that this feature is only available with Python 3.7 or higher.\n\n  * Improve the informativeness of error messages raised by Keras\n    `Layer.__call__()`, by adding the full list of argument values passed to the\n    layer in every exception.\n\n*   TF1 -> TF2 Migration\n    * Introduced the `tf.compat.v1.keras.utils.track_tf1_style_variables`\n      decorator, which enables using large classes of tf1-style variable_scope,\n      `get_variable`, and `compat.v1.layer`-based components from within TF2\n      models running with TF2 behavior enabled.\n\n*  `tf.data`:\n    *   tf.data service now supports auto-sharding. Users specify the sharding\n        policy with `tf.data.experimental.service.ShardingPolicy` enum. It can\n        be one of OFF (equivalent to today's `\"parallel_epochs\"` mode), DYNAMIC\n        (equivalent to today's `\"distributed_epoch\"` mode), or one of the static\n        sharding policies: FILE, DATA, FILE_OR_DATA, or HINT (corresponding to\n        values of `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy`).\n\n        Static sharding (auto-sharding) requires the number of tf.data service\n        workers be fixed. Users need to specify the worker addresses in\n        `tensorflow.data.experimental.DispatcherConfig`.\n    *   `tf.data.experimental.service.register_dataset` now accepts optional\n        `compression` argument.\n\n*  Keras:\n  *  `tf.keras.layers.Conv` now includes a public `convolution_op` method.\n      This method can be used to simplify the implementation of Conv subclasses.\n      There are two primary ways to use this new method.  The first is to use the method directly in your own `call` method:\n      ```\n        class StandardizedConv2D(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D):\n          def call(self, inputs):\n            mean, var = tf.nn.moments(self.kernel, axes=[0, 1, 2], keepdims=True)\n            return self.convolution_op(inputs, (self.kernel - mean) / tf.sqrt(var + 1e-10))\n      ```\n      Alternatively, you can override `convolution_op`:\n      ```\n        class StandardizedConv2D(tf.keras.Layer):\n          def convolution_op(self, inputs, kernel):\n            mean, var = tf.nn.moments(kernel, axes=[0, 1, 2], keepdims=True)\n            # Author code uses std + 1e-5\n            return super().convolution_op(inputs, (kernel - mean) / tf.sqrt(var + 1e-10))\n      ```\n  * Added `merge_state()` method to `tf.keras.metrics.Metric` for use in\n    distributed computations.\n  * Added `sparse` and `ragged` options to `tf.keras.layers.TextVectorization`\n    to allow for `SparseTensor` and `RaggedTensor` outputs from the layer.\n*  distribute.experimental.rpc package:\n   * distribute.experimental.rpc package introduces APIs to create a GRPC based\n    server to register tf.function methods and a GRPC client to invoke remote\n    registered methods. RPC APIs are intended for multi-client setups i.e. server\n  and clients are started in separate binaries independently.\n\n   * Example usage to create server:\n     ```\n        server = tf.distribute.experimental.rpc.Server.create(\"grpc\", \n                \"127.0.0.1:1234\")\n        @tf.function(input_signature=[\n          tf.TensorSpec([], tf.int32),\n          tf.TensorSpec([], dtypes.int32)\n        ])\n        def _remote_multiply(a, b):\n          return tf.math.multiply(a, b)\n\n        server.register(\"multiply\", _remote_multiply)\n     ```\n    * Example usage to create client:\n      ```\n      client = tf.distribute.experimental.rpc.Client.create(\"grpc\", address)\n      a = tf.constant(2, dtype=tf.int32)\n      b = tf.constant(3, dtype=tf.int32)\n      result = client.multiply(a, b)\n      ```\n* `tf.lite`:\n  * Add experimental API `experimental_from_jax` to support conversion from Jax\n    models to TensorFlow Lite.\n  * Support uint32 data type for cast op.\n  * Add experimental quantization debugger `tf.lite.QuantizationDebugger`\n\n* Extension Types\n  * Add experimental API to define new Python classes that can be handled by\n    TensorFlow APIs.  To create an extension type, simply define a Python class\n    with `tf.experimental.ExtensionType` as its base, and use type annotations\n    to specify the type for each field.  E.g.:\n    ```\n    class MaskedTensor(tf.experimental.ExtensionType):\n      values: tf.Tensor\n      mask: tf.Tensor\n    ```\n    The `tf.ExtensionType` base class works similarly to\n    [`typing.NamedTuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple)\n    and [`@dataclasses.dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass)\n    from the standard Python library.\n  * Extension types are supported by Keras, tf.data, TF-hub, SavedModel,\n    tf.function, control flow ops, py_function, and distribution strategy.\n  * Add \"dispatch decorators\" that can be used to override the default behavior\n    of TensorFlow ops (such as `tf.add` or `tf.concat`) when they are applied to\n    ExtensionType values.\n  * The `BatchableExtensionType` API can be used to define extension types that\n    support APIs that make use of batching, such as `tf.data.Dataset` and\n    `tf.map_fn`.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*<SIMILAR TO ABOVE SECTION, BUT FOR OTHER IMPORTANT CHANGES / BUG FIXES>\n*<IF A CHANGE CLOSES A GITHUB ISSUE, IT SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED HERE>\n*<NOTES SHOULD BE GROUPED PER AREA>\n*   TF Core:\n    * Random number generation (RNG) system\n        *   Added argument `alg` to `tf.random.stateless_*` functions to explicitly select the RNG algorithm.\n        *   Added `tf.nn.experimental.stateless_dropout`, a stateless version of `tf.nn.dropout`.\n        *   `tf.random.Generator` now can be created inside the scope of `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` and `tf.distribute.experimental.CentralStorageStrategy`.\n    * Added an experimental session config\n      `tf.experimental.disable_functional_ops_lowering` which disables\n      functional control flow op lowering optimization. This is useful when\n      executing within a portable runtime where control flow op kernels may not\n      be loaded due to selective registration.\n    * Added a new experimental argument `experimental_is_anonymous` to the\n      `__init__` function of `tf.lookup.StaticHashTable`,\n      `tf.lookup.StaticVocabularyTable`,\n      `tf.lookup.experimental.MutableHashTable` and\n      `tf.lookup.experimental.DenseHashTable`, to create the table in anonymous\n      mode. In this mode, the table resource can only be accessed via resource\n      handles (not resource names) and will be deleted automatically when all\n      resource handles pointing to it are gone.\n*   `tf.data`:\n    *   Introducing the `tf.data.experimental.at` API which provides random\n        access for input pipelines that consist of transformations that support\n        random access. The initial set of transformations that support random\n        access includes: `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices`,\n        `tf.data.Dataset.shuffle`, `tf.data.Dataset.batch`,\n        `tf.data.Dataset.shard`, `tf.data.Dataset.map`,\n        `tf.data.Dataset.range`, `tf.data.Dataset.skip`.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.Options.experimental_deterministic` API to\n        `tf.data.Options.deterministic` and deprecating the experimental\n        endpoint.\n    *   Moving autotuning options from\n        `tf.data.Options.experimental_optimization.autotune*` to a newly created\n        `tf.data.Options.autotune.*` and removing support for\n        `tf.data.Options.experimental_optimization.autotune_buffers`.\n    *   Added support for user-defined names of tf.data core Python API, which\n        can be used to disambiguate tf.data events in TF Profiler Trace Viewer.\n    *   Promoting\n        `tf.data.experimental.sample_from_datasets` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.sample_from_datasets` and deprecating the experimental\n        endpoint.\n    *   Promoting\n        `tf.data.experimental.choose_from_datasets` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.choose_from_datasets` and deprecating the experimental\n        endpoint.\n*   TF SavedModel:\n    *   Custom gradients are now saved by default. See `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions` to disable this.\n*   XLA:\n    * Added a new API that allows custom call functions to signal errors. The\n      old API will be deprecated in a future release. See\n      https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/custom_call for details.\n    * XLA:GPU reductions are deterministic by default (reductions within\n      `jit_compile=True` are now deterministic).\n    * XLA:GPU works with Horovod (OSS contribution by Trent Lo from NVidia)\n*   `tf.saved_model.save`:\n    *   When saving a model, not specifying a namespace whitelist for custom\n        ops with a namespace will now default to allowing rather than rejecting\n        them all.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n<INSERT>, <NAME>, <HERE>, <USING>, <GITHUB>, <HANDLE>\n\n# Release 2.6.0\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n*   `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite` is removed, as\n    the API only works in graph mode and is not customizable. The function is\n    still accessible under\n    `tf.compat.v1.mixed_precision.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite`, but it\n    is recommended to use the\n    [Keras mixed precision API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision)\n    instead.\n\n*   `tf.lite`:\n\n    *   Remove `experimental.nn.dynamic_rnn`, `experimental.nn.TfLiteRNNCell`\n        and `experimental.nn.TfLiteLSTMCell` since they're no longer supported.\n        It's recommended to just use\n        [keras lstm](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM)\n        instead.\n\n*   `tf.keras`:\n\n    *   Keras been split into a separate PIP package (`keras`), and its code has\n        been moved to the GitHub\n        repository[keras-team/keras](http://github.com/keras-team/keras). The\n        API endpoints for `tf.keras` stay unchanged, but are now backed by the\n        `keras` PIP package. The existing code in tensorflow/python/keras is a\n        staled copy and will be removed in future release (2.7). Please remove\n        any imports to `tensorflow.python.keras` and replace them with public\n        tf.keras API instead.\n    *   The methods `Model.to_yaml()` and `keras.models.model_from_yaml` have\n        been replaced to raise a `RuntimeError` as they can be abused to cause\n        arbitrary code execution. It is recommended to use JSON serialization\n        instead of YAML, or, a better alternative, serialize to H5.\n\n## Known Caveats\n\n*   TF Core:\n    *   A longstanding bug in `tf.while_loop`, which caused it to execute\n        sequentially, even when `parallel_iterations>1`, has now been fixed.\n        However, the increased parallelism may result in increased memory use.\n        Users who experience unwanted regressions should reset their\n        `while_loop`'s `parallel_iterations` value to 1, which is consistent\n        with prior behavior.\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n*   `tf.keras`:\n\n    *   Keras has been split into a separate PIP package (`keras`), and its code\n        has been moved to the GitHub repository\n        [keras-team/keras](http://github.com/keras-team/keras). The API\n        endpoints for `tf.keras` stay unchanged, but are now backed by the\n        `keras` PIP package. All Keras-related PRs and issues should now be\n        directed to the GitHub repository.\n        [keras-team/keras](http://github.com/keras-team/keras).\n    *   `tf.keras.utils.experimental.DatasetCreator` now takes an optional\n        `tf.distribute.InputOptions` for specific options when used with\n        distribution.\n    *   `tf.keras.experimental.SidecarEvaluator` is now available for a program\n        intended to be run on an evaluator task, which is commonly used to\n        supplement a training cluster running with\n        `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` (see\n        `https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training).\n        It can also be used with single-worker training or other strategies. See\n        docstring for more info.\n    *   Preprocessing layers moved from experimental to core.\n        *   Import paths moved from `tf.keras.layers.preprocessing.experimental`\n            to `tf.keras.layers`.\n    *   Updates to Preprocessing layers API for consistency and clarity:\n        *   `StringLookup` and `IntegerLookup` default for `mask_token` changed\n            to `None`. This matches the default masking behavior of `Hashing`\n            and `Embedding` layers. To keep existing behavior, pass\n            `mask_token=\"\"` during layer creation.\n        *   Renamed `\"binary\"` output mode to `\"multi_hot\"` for\n            `CategoryEncoding`, `StringLookup`, `IntegerLookup`, and\n            `TextVectorization`. Multi-hot encoding will no longer automatically\n            uprank rank 1 inputs, so these layers can now multi-hot encode\n            unbatched multi-dimensional samples.\n        *   Added a new output mode `\"one_hot\"` for `CategoryEncoding`,\n            `StringLookup`, `IntegerLookup`, which will encode each element in\n            an input batch individually, and automatically append a new output\n            dimension if necessary. Use this mode on rank 1 inputs for the old\n            `\"binary\"` behavior of one-hot encoding a batch of scalars.\n        *   `Normalization` will no longer automatically uprank rank 1 inputs,\n            allowing normalization of unbatched multi-dimensional samples.\n\n*   `tf.lite`:\n\n    *   The recommended Android NDK version for building TensorFlow Lite has\n        been changed from r18b to r19c.\n    *   Supports int64 for mul.\n    *   Supports native variable builtin ops - ReadVariable, AssignVariable.\n    *   Converter:\n        *   Experimental support for variables in TFLite. To enable through\n            conversion, users need to set\n            `experimental_enable_resource_variables` on tf.lite.TFLiteConverter\n            to True. Note: mutable variables is only available using\n            `from_saved_model` in this release, support for other methods is\n            coming soon.\n        *   Old Converter (TOCO) is getting removed from next release. It's been\n            deprecated for few releases already.\n    *   lite.experimental.authoring.compatible API:\n        *   A Python decorator to provide a way to check TFLite compatibility\n            issue of `tf.function`. This returns a callable object which\n            validates TFLite compatibility. If an incompatible operation is\n            encountered during execution, an exception will be raised with\n            information about the incompatible ops.\n    *   lite.experimental.Analyzer API:\n        *   An experimental tool to analyze TFLite flatbuffer models. This API\n            can be used to investigate TFLite model structure and check\n            compatibility with GPU delegate.\n\n*   `tf.saved_model`:\n\n    *   SavedModels can now save custom gradients. Use the option\n        `tf.saved_model.SaveOption(experimental_custom_gradients=True)` to\n        enable this feature. The documentation in\n        [Advanced autodiff](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/advanced_autodiff#custom_gradients)\n        has been updated.\n    *   Object metadata has now been deprecated and no longer saved to the\n        SavedModel.\n\n*   TF Core:\n\n    *   Added `tf.config.experimental.reset_memory_stats` to reset the tracked\n        peak memory returned by `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info`.\n\n*   `tf.data`:\n\n    *   Added `target_workers` param to `data_service_ops.from_dataset_id` and\n        `data_service_ops.distribute`. Users can specify `\"AUTO\"`, `\"ANY\"`, or\n        `\"LOCAL\"` (case insensitive). If `\"AUTO\"`, tf.data service runtime\n        decides which workers to read from. If `\"ANY\"`, TF workers read from any\n        tf.data service workers. If `\"LOCAL\"`, TF workers will only read from\n        local in-processs tf.data service workers. `\"AUTO\"` works well for most\n        cases, while users can specify other targets. For example, `\"LOCAL\"`\n        would help avoid RPCs and data copy if every TF worker colocates with a\n        tf.data service worker. Currently, `\"AUTO\"` reads from any tf.data\n        service workers to preserve existing behavior. The default value is\n        `\"AUTO\"`.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   TF Core:\n    *   Added `tf.lookup.experimental.MutableHashTable`, which provides a\n        generic mutable hash table implementation.\n        *   Compared to `tf.lookup.experimental.DenseHashTable` this offers\n            lower overall memory usage, and a cleaner API. It does not require\n            specifying a `delete_key` and `empty_key` that cannot be inserted\n            into the table.\n    *   Added support for specifying number of subdivisions in all reduce host\n        collective. This parallelizes work on CPU and speeds up the collective\n        performance. Default behavior is unchanged.\n    *   Add an option `perturb_singular` to `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve` that\n        allows solving linear systems with a numerically singular tridiagonal\n        matrix, e.g. for use in inverse iteration.\n    *   Added `tf.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal` that computes the eigenvalues of a\n        Hermitian tridiagonal matrix.\n    *   `tf.constant` now places its output on the current default device.\n    *   SavedModel\n        *   Added `tf.saved_model.experimental.TrackableResource`, which allows\n            the creation of custom wrapper objects for resource tensors.\n        *   Added a SavedModel load option to allow restoring partial\n            checkpoints into the SavedModel. See\n            [`tf.saved_model.LoadOptions`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/LoadOptions)\n            for details.\n    *   Added a new op `SparseSegmentSumGrad` to match the other sparse segment\n        gradient ops and avoid an extra gather operation that was in the\n        previous gradient implementation.\n    *   Added a new session config setting `internal_fragmentation_fraction`,\n        which controls when the BFC Allocator needs to split an oversized chunk\n        to satisfy an allocation request.\n    *   Added `tf.get_current_name_scope()` which returns the current full name\n        scope string that will be prepended to op names.\n*   `tf.data`:\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.bucket_by_sequence_length` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.bucket_by_sequence_length` and deprecating the\n        experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.get_single_element` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.get_single_element` and deprecating the experimental\n        endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.group_by_window` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.group_by_window` and deprecating the experimental\n        endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.RandomDataset` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.random` and deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.scan` API to `tf.data.Dataset.scan` and\n        deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.snapshot` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.shapshot` and deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.take_while` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.take_while` and deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.ThreadingOptions` API to\n        `tf.data.ThreadingOptions` and deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.unique` API to `tf.data.Dataset.unique`\n        and deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Added `stop_on_empty_dataset` parameter to `sample_from_datasets` and\n        `choose_from_datasets`. Setting `stop_on_empty_dataset=True` will stop\n        sampling if it encounters an empty dataset. This preserves the sampling\n        ratio throughout training. The prior behavior was to continue sampling,\n        skipping over exhausted datasets, until all datasets are exhausted. By\n        default, the original behavior (`stop_on_empty_dataset=False`) is\n        preserved.\n    *   Removed previously deprecated tf.data statistics related APIs:\n        *   `tf.data.Options.experimental_stats`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.StatsAggregator`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.StatsOptions.*`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.bytes_produced_stats`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.latency_stats`\n    *   Removed the following experimental tf.data optimization APIs:\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.MapVectorizationOptions.*`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions.filter_with_random_uniform_fusion`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions.hoist_random_uniform`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions.map_vectorization` *\n            `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions.reorder_data_discarding_ops`\n*   `tf.keras`:\n    *   Fix usage of `__getitem__` slicing in Keras Functional APIs when the\n        inputs are `RaggedTensor` objects.\n    *   Add `keepdims` argument to all `GlobalPooling` layers.\n    *   Add `include_preprocessing` argument to `MobileNetV3` architectures to\n        control the inclusion of `Rescaling` layer in the model.\n    *   Add optional argument (`force`) to `make_(train|test|predict)_funtion`\n        methods to skip the cached function and generate a new one. This is\n        useful to regenerate in a single call the compiled training function\n        when any `.trainable` attribute of any model's layer has changed.\n    *   Models now have a `save_spec` property which contains the `TensorSpec`\n        specs for calling the model. This spec is automatically saved when the\n        model is called for the first time.\n*   `tf.linalg`:\n    *   Add `CompositeTensor` as a base class to `LinearOperator`.\n*   `tf.lite`:\n    *   Fix mean op reference quantization rounding issue.\n    *   Added `framework_stable` BUILD target, which links in only the\n        non-experimental TF Lite APIs.\n    *   Remove deprecated Java `Interpreter` methods:\n        *   `modifyGraphWithDelegate` - Use `Interpreter.Options.addDelegate`\n        *   `setNumThreads` - Use `Interpreter.Options.setNumThreads`\n    *   Add Conv3DTranspose as a builtin op.\n*   `tf.summary`:\n    *   Fix `tf.summary.should_record_summaries()` so it correctly reflects when\n        summaries will be written, even when `tf.summary.record_if()` is not n\n        effect, by returning True tensor if default writer is present.\n*   Grappler:\n    *   Disable default Grappler optimization timeout to make the optimization\n        pipeline deterministic. This may lead to increased model loading time,\n        because time spent in graph optimizations is now unbounded (was 20\n        minutes).\n*   Deterministic Op Functionality (enabled by setting `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to\n    `\"true\"` or `\"1\"`):\n    *   Add a deterministic GPU implementation of\n        `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`. See PR\n        [49178](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/49178).\n    *   Add a deterministic CPU implementation of `tf.image.crop_and_resize`.\n        See PR [48905](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/48905).\n    *   Add determinism-unimplemented exception-throwing to the following ops.\n        When op-determinism is expected, an attempt to use the specified paths\n        through the following ops on a GPU will cause\n        `tf.errors.UnimplementedError` (with an understandable message) to be\n        thrown.\n        *   `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` forwards and/or\n            backwards.

Major Features and Improvements\n\n*   Support for Python3.9 has been added.\n*   `tf.data`:\n    *   `tf.data` service now supports strict round-robin reads, which is useful\n        for synchronous training workloads where example sizes vary. With strict\n        round robin reads, users can guarantee that consumers get similar-sized\n        examples in the same step.\n    *   tf.data service now supports optional compression. Previously data would\n        always be compressed, but now you can disable compression by passing\n        `compression=None` to `tf.data.experimental.service.distribute(...)`.\n    *   `tf.data.Dataset.batch()` now supports `num_parallel_calls` and\n        `deterministic` arguments. `num_parallel_calls` is used to indicate that\n        multiple input batches should be computed in parallel. With\n        `num_parallel_calls` set, `deterministic` is used to indicate that\n        outputs can be obtained in the non-deterministic order.\n    *   Options returned by `tf.data.Dataset.options()` are no longer mutable.\n    *   tf.data input pipelines can now be executed in debug mode, which\n        disables any asynchrony, parallelism, or non-determinism and forces\n        Python execution (as opposed to trace-compiled graph execution) of\n        user-defined functions passed into transformations such as `map`. The\n        debug mode can be enabled through\n        `tf.data.experimental.enable_debug_mode()`.\n*   `tf.lite`\n    *   Enabled the new MLIR-based quantization backend by default\n        *   The new backend is used for 8 bits full integer post-training\n            quantization\n        *   The new backend removes the redundant rescales and fixes some bugs\n            (shared weight/bias, extremely small scales, etc)\n        *   Set `experimental_new_quantizer` in tf.lite.TFLiteConverter to False\n            to disable this change\n*   `tf.keras`\n    *   `tf.keras.metrics.AUC` now support logit predictions.\n    *   Enabled a new supported input type in `Model.fit`,\n        `tf.keras.utils.experimental.DatasetCreator`, which takes a callable,\n        `dataset_fn`. `DatasetCreator` is intended to work across all\n        `tf.distribute` strategies, and is the only input type supported for\n        Parameter Server strategy.\n*   `tf.distribute`\n    *   `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` now supports\n        training with Keras `Model.fit` when used with `DatasetCreator`.\n    *   Creating `tf.random.Generator` under `tf.distribute.Strategy` scopes is\n        now allowed (except for\n        `tf.distribute.experimental.CentralStorageStrategy` and\n        `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`). Different\n        replicas will get different random-number streams.\n*   TPU embedding support\n    *   Added `profile_data_directory` to `EmbeddingConfigSpec` in\n        `_tpu_estimator_embedding.py`. This allows embedding lookup statistics\n        gathered at runtime to be used in embedding layer partitioning\n        decisions.\n*   PluggableDevice\n    *   Third-party devices can now connect to TensorFlow as plug-ins through\n        [StreamExecutor C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200612-stream-executor-c-api.md).\n        and\n        [PluggableDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200624-pluggable-device-for-tensorflow.md)\n        interface.\n        *   Add custom ops and kernels through\n            [kernel and op registration C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190814-kernel-and-op-registration.md).\n        *   Register custom graph optimization passes with\n            [graph optimization C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20201027-modular-tensorflow-graph-c-api.md).\n*   [oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN)\n    CPU performance optimizations from\n    [Intel-optimized TensorFlow](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html)\n    are now available in the official x86-64 Linux and Windows builds.\n    *   They are off by default. Enable them by setting the environment variable\n        `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=1`.\n    *   We do not recommend using them in GPU systems, as they have not been\n        sufficiently tested with GPUs yet.\n*   TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11.2 and cuDNN 8.1.0\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n*   The `TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL` environment variable has been renamed to to\n    `TF_CPP_MAX_VLOG_LEVEL` which correctly describes its effect.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   `tf.keras`:\n\n    *   Preprocessing layers API consistency changes:\n        *   `StringLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and\n            `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as\n            `TextVectorization`.\n        *   `IntegerLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and\n            `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as\n            `TextVectorization`. Renamed `max_values`, `oov_value` and\n            `mask_value` to `max_tokens`, `oov_token` and `mask_token` to align\n            with `StringLookup` and `TextVectorization`.\n        *   `TextVectorization` default for `pad_to_max_tokens` switched to\n            False.\n        *   `CategoryEncoding` no longer supports `adapt`, `IntegerLookup` now\n            supports equivalent functionality. `max_tokens` argument renamed to\n            `num_tokens`.\n        *   `Discretization` added `num_bins` argument for learning bins\n            boundaries through calling `adapt` on a dataset. Renamed `bins`\n            argument to `bin_boundaries` for specifying bins without `adapt`.\n    *   Improvements to model saving/loading:\n        *   `model.load_weights` now accepts paths to saved models.\n    *   Keras inputs can now be created directly from arbitrary `tf.TypeSpecs`.\n    *   Two new learning rate schedules added:\n        `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay`\n        and`tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecayRestarts`.\n\n*   `tf.data`:\n\n    *   Exposing `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy`, which can be used\n        to control how external state should be handled during dataset\n        serialization or iterator checkpointing.\n    *   Changing `tf.data.experimental.save` to store the type specification of\n        the dataset elements. This avoids the need for explicitly specifying the\n        `element_spec` argument of `tf.data.experimental.load` when loading the\n        previously saved dataset.\n    *   Add `.element_spec` property to `tf.data.DatasetSpec` to access the\n        inner spec. This can be used to extract the structure of nested\n        datasets.\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardingPolicy.HINT` which can be used to\n        provide hints to tf.distribute-based auto-sharding as to where in the\n        input pipeline to insert sharding transformations.\n    *   Make tf.data.Options persistent across `tf.function` and `GraphDef`\n        boundaries.\n\n*   XLA compilation:\n\n    *   `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` has become a stable API,\n        renamed `tf.function(jit_compile=True)`.\n    *   XLA can now compile MirroredStrategy: the step function passed\n        to`strategy.run` can now be annoted with `jit_compile=True`.\n\n*   `tf.distribute`:\n\n    *   Rename `experimental_prefetch_to_device` in `tf.distribute.InputOptions`\n        to `experimental_fetch_to_device` to better reflect the purpose.\n\n*   `tf.lite`:\n\n    *   class `tflite::Subgraph`:\n        *   Removed the `tensors()` method and the non-const overload of the\n            `nodes_and_registration()` method, both of which were previously\n            documented as temporary and to be removed.\n            *   Uses of `tensors()` can be replaced by calling the existing\n                methods `tensors_size()` and `tensor(int)`.\n            *   Uses of the non-const overload of `nodes_and_registration` can\n                be replaced by calling the existing methods `nodes_size()` and\n                `context()`, and then calling the `GetNodeAndRegistration`\n                method in the `TfLiteContext` returned by `context()`.\n    *   NNAPI\n        *   Removed deprecated `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API.\n            *   Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods\n                directly.\n        *   Replaced the model cache key for models computation algorithm with\n            one guaranteed to be stable across runs.\n    *   16 bits quantization\n        *   Added int16x8 support for ABS, REDUCE_MAX and REDUCE_MIN operators.\n        *   Additional tests and fixes for ADD and SUB operators.\n    *   Added support for saved model's session initializer through\n        `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\n    *   Added DEPTH_TO_SPACE support in Post training quantization.\n    *   Added dynamic range quantization support for the BatchMatMul op.\n        *   Both symmetric and asymmetric quantized input tensor are supported.\n    *   Add `RFFT2D` as builtin op. (`RFFT2D` also supports `RFFTD`.) Currently\n        only supports float32 input.\n    *   Add 5D support to `SLICE` op.\n    *   TFLite Supports SingatureDef:\n        *   TFLiteConverter exports models with SignatureDef\n        *   Interpreter supports getting a list of signatures and getting\n            callable function for a given signaturedef.\n    *   Add int8 support for `ReshapeV2`.\n    *   Add experimental support for optimization with sparsity.\n    *   Add nominal support for unsigned 32-bit integer tensor types. Note that\n        very few TFLite kernels support this type natively, so its use in mobile\n        ML authoring is generally discouraged.\n    *   Add support for static hash tables through\n        `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\n    *   The Python TF Lite Interpreter bindings now has an option\n        `experimental_preserve_all_tensors` to aid in debugging conversion.\n    *   Quantized x86 execution defaults to Ruy GEMM library for platforms with\n        AVX support.\n    *   Deprecate\n        `tf.compat.v1.lite.experimental.get_potentially_supported_ops`. Use\n        `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` directly to check whether a model is\n        convertible.\n    *   Add support to select one of three different built-in op resolvers\n    *   Enabled post training with calibrations for models that require user\n        provided TensorFlow Lite custom op libraries via\n        `converter.target_spec._experimental_custom_op_registerers`. used in\n        Python Interpreter API.\n\n*   TF Core:\n\n    *   Corrected higher-order gradients of control flow constructs (`tf.cond`,\n        `tf.while_loop`, and compositions like `tf.foldl`) computed with\n        `tf.GradientTape` inside a `tf.function`.\n    *   Changed the default step size in `gradient_checker_v2.compute_gradients`\n        to be exactly representable as a binary floating point numbers. This\n        avoids poluting gradient approximations needlessly, which is some cases\n        leads to false negatives in op gradient tests.\n    *   Added `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info`, returning a dict with\n        the current and peak memory usage. Deprecated\n        `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` in favor of this new function.\n    *   Extended `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution` to\n        control Tensor-Float-32 evaluation in RNNs.\n    *   Added a 'experimental_payloads' field to tf.errors.OpError and its\n        subclasses to support more detailed error reporting. This is inspired\n        from Abseil Status payloads:\n        https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/status/status.h\n\n*   `tf.summary`:\n\n    *   New `tf.summary.graph` allows manual write of TensorFlow graph\n        (`tf.Graph` or `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef`) as a summary. This is not a\n        replacement for the trace-based API.\n\n*   Set `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` by default for Windows builds. This\n    provides a big compile-time speedup, and effectively raises the minimum\n    supported MSVC version to 16.4 (current: 16.8).\n\n    *   See:\n        https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/build/SsW98Eo7l3o/discussion\n\n*   TensorRT\n\n    *   Removed the deprecated `session_config` parameter for the TF1-TRT\n        converter `TrtGraphConverter`. Previously, we issued a warning when the\n        value of the parameter is not None.\n    *   The TF2-TRT converter `TrtGraphConverterV2` takes an object of class\n        TrtConversionParams as a parameter. Removed three deprecated fields from\n        this class: `rewriter_config_template`, `is_dynamic_op`, and\n        `max_batch_size`. Previously, we issued a warning when the value of\n        `rewriter_config_template` is not None. We issued an error when the\n        value of `is_dynamic_op` is not True. We didn't use the value for\n        `max_batch_size` for building TensorRT engines. Add parameters\n        `use_dynamic_shape` to enable dynamic shape support. The default is to\n        disable dynamic shape support. Add `dynamic_shape_profile_strategy` for\n        selecting a dynamic shape profile strategy. The default is profile\n        strategy is `Range`.\n    *   Issue a warning when function get_tensorrt_rewriter_config is used.\n\n*   TF XLA\n\n    *   Add new enum value `MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_ENABLED` to\n        `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a \\\"safe\\\" mode.\n        This runs the MLIR bridge only when an analysis of the graph only when\n        an analysis of the graph determines that it is safe to run.\n    *   Add new enum value `MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_FALLBACK_ENABLED'\n        to`tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a fallback for\n        the MLIR bridge in a \\\"safe\\\" mode. This runs the MLIR bridge in a\n        FallbackEnabled mode when an analysis of the graph determines that the\n        graph does not have unsupported features.\n\n*   Deterministic Op Functionality:\n\n    *   Add determinism-unimplemented exception-throwing to the segment-sum ops.\n        When the environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` is set to `\"true\"`\n        or `\"1\"` (when op-determinism is expected), an attempt to run the\n        following ops on a GPU will throw `tf.errors.UnimplementedError` (with\n        an understandable message) when `data` is a floating-point type,\n        including complex types (if supported): `tf.math.segment_prod`,\n        `tf.math.segment_sum`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_mean`,\n        `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sqrt_n`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_prod`,\n        `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum`, and therefore also\n        `tf.convert_to_tensor` when `value` is of type `tf.IndexedSlices` (such\n        as in the back prop though `tf.gather` into a dense embedding). See\n        issue [39751](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39751)\n        which this change addresses, but does not solve. This exception-throwing\n        behavior can be disabled by setting the environment variable\n        `TF_DISABLE_SEGMENT_REDUCTION_OP_DETERMINISM_EXCEPTIONS` to `\"true\"` or\n        `\"1\"`. For more information about these changes, see the description in\n        pull request\n        [47772](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/47772).\n    *   In previous versions of TensorFlow, when a GPU was available,\n        `tf.sparse.sparse_dense_matmul` introduced truly random noise in the\n        forward path for data of type `tf.float32` but not for data of type\n        `tf.float64` (for which there was no GPU implementation). In this\n        current release, GPU support for other floating-point types\n        (`tf.float16`, `tf.float64`, `tf.complex64`, and `tf.complex128`) has\n        been added for this op. If you were relying on the determinism of the\n        `tf.float64` CPU implementation being automatically selected because of\n        the absence of the `tf.float64` GPU implementation, you with either need\n        to force the op to run on the CPU or use a different data type.\n\n*   Security\n\n    *   Fixes a heap buffer overflow in `RaggedBinCount`\n

`3.44.0` to keep in sync with master branch.\n\n# Release 2.4.0\n\n ## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* `tf.distribute` introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of\n  models via the [`tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy)\n  API. Please see the [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training)\n  to learn more.\n\n* [`MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy)\n  is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the\n  major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please\n  check out the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worker training with Keras]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).\n\n* Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy) which is a\n  NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. See the [detailed guide]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy) to learn more. Additional details below.\n\n* Adds Support for\n  [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/)\n  on Ampere based GPUs. TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for\n  NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs and is enabled by default.\n\n* A major refactoring of the internals of the Keras Functional API has been\n  completed, that should improve the reliability, stability, and performance of\n  constructing Functional models.\n\n* Keras mixed precision API [`tf.keras.mixed_precision`]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly)\n  is no longer experimental and allows the use of 16-bit floating point formats\n  during training, improving performance by up to 3x on GPUs and 60% on TPUs.\n  Please see below for additional details.\n\n* TensorFlow Profiler now supports profiling `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` and\n  tracing multiple workers using the [sampling mode API]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis).\n\n* TFLite Profiler for Android is available. See the detailed [guide]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/measurement#trace_tensorflow_lite_internals_in_android)\n  to learn more.\n\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11 and cuDNN 8.0.2.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n* TF Core:\n  * Certain float32 ops run in lower precision on Ampere based GPUs, including\n  matmuls and convolutions, due to the use of [TensorFloat-32]\n  (https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/).\n  Specifically, inputs to such ops are rounded from 23 bits of precision to 10\n  bits of precision. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice for deep learning\n  models. In some cases, TensorFloat-32 is also used for complex64 ops.\n  TensorFloat-32 can be disabled by running `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution(False)`.\n  * The byte layout for string tensors across the C-API has been updated to match\n  TF Core/C++; i.e., a contiguous array of `tensorflow::tstring`/`TF_TString`s.\n  * C-API functions `TF_StringDecode`, `TF_StringEncode`, and `TF_StringEncodedSize`\n  are no longer relevant and have been removed; see `core/platform/ctstring.h` for\n  string access/modification in C.\n  * `tensorflow.python`, `tensorflow.core` and `tensorflow.compiler` modules are\n  now hidden. These modules are not part of TensorFlow public API.\n  * `tf.raw_ops.Max` and `tf.raw_ops.Min` no longer accept inputs of type\n  `tf.complex64` or `tf.complex128`, because the behavior of these ops is not\n  well defined for complex types.\n  * XLA:CPU and XLA:GPU devices are no longer registered by default. Use\n  `TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` if you really need them, but this\n  flag will eventually be removed in subsequent releases.\n\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * The `steps_per_execution` argument in `model.compile()` is no longer experimental;\n  if you were passing `experimental_steps_per_execution`, rename it to\n  `steps_per_execution` in your code. This argument controls the number of batches\n  to run during each `tf.function` call when calling `model.fit()`. Running multiple\n  batches inside a single `tf.function` call can greatly improve performance on\n  TPUs or small models with a large Python overhead.\n  * A **major refactoring** of the internals of the Keras Functional API may affect code that\n  is relying on certain internal details:\n    * Code that uses `isinstance(x, tf.Tensor)` instead of `tf.is_tensor` when\n  checking Keras symbolic inputs/outputs should switch to using `tf.is_tensor`.\n    * Code that is overly dependent on the exact names attached to symbolic tensors\n  (e.g. assumes there will be \":0\" at the end of the inputs, treats names as\n  unique identifiers instead of using `tensor.ref()`, etc.) may break.\n    * Code that uses full path for `get_concrete_function` to trace Keras symbolic\n  inputs directly should switch to building matching `tf.TensorSpec`s directly and\n  tracing the `TensorSpec` objects.\n    * Code that relies on the exact number and names of the op layers that TensorFlow\n  operations  were converted into may have changed.\n    * Code that uses `tf.map_fn`/`tf.cond`/`tf.while_loop`/control flow as op layers\n  and  happens to work before TF 2.4. These will explicitly be unsupported now.\n  Converting these ops to Functional API op layers was unreliable before TF 2.4,\n  and prone to erroring incomprehensibly  or being silently buggy.\n    * Code that directly asserts on a Keras symbolic value in cases where ops\n  like `tf.rank` used to  return a static or symbolic value depending on if the\n  input had a fully static shape or not. Now these ops always return symbolic values.\n    * Code already susceptible to leaking tensors outside of graphs becomes slightly\n  more likely to do so now.\n    * Code that tries directly getting gradients with respect to symbolic Keras\n  inputs/outputs. Use `GradientTape` on the actual Tensors passed to the already-constructed\n  model instead.\n    * Code that requires very tricky shape manipulation via converted op layers\n  in order to work, where the Keras symbolic shape inference proves insufficient.\n    * Code that tries manually walking a `tf.keras.Model` layer by layer and assumes\n  layers only ever have one positional argument. This assumption doesn't hold\n  true before TF 2.4 either, but is more likely to cause issues now.\n    * Code that manually enters `keras.backend.get_graph()` before building a\n  functional model is no longer needed.\n    * Start enforcing input shape assumptions when calling Functional API Keras\n  models. This may potentially break some users, in case there is a mismatch\n  between the shape used when creating `Input` objects in a Functional model,\n  and the shape of the data passed to that model. You can fix this mismatch by\n  either calling the model with correctly-shaped data, or by relaxing `Input` shape\n  assumptions (note that you can pass shapes with `None` entries for axes that\n  are meant to be dynamic). You can also disable the input checking entirely by\n  setting `model.input_spec = None`.\n  * Several changes have been made to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental`.\n  Note that it is now recommended to use the non-experimental\n  `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API.\n   * `AutoCastVariable.dtype` now refers to the actual variable dtype, not the\n  dtype it will be casted to.\n   * When mixed precision is enabled, `tf.keras.layers.Embedding` now outputs a\n  float16 or bfloat16 tensor instead of a float32 tensor.\n   * The property `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer.loss_scale`\n  is now a tensor, not a `LossScale` object. This means to get a loss scale\n  of a `LossScaleOptimizer` as a tensor, you must now call `opt.loss_scale`instead of `opt.loss_scale()`.\n   * The property `should_cast_variables` has been removed from `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy`\n   * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`,\n  the `DynamicLossScale`'s multiplier must be 2.\n   * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to\n  `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, the weights of\n  the `DynanmicLossScale` are copied into the `LossScaleOptimizer` instead of being reused.\n  This means modifying the weights of the `DynamicLossScale` will no longer affect the weights of the LossScaleOptimizer, and vice versa.\n   * The global policy can no longer be set to a non-floating point policy in `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy`\n   * In `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will no longer be casted within\n  `MirroredStrategy.run` or `ReplicaContext.merge_call`. This is because a thread local\n  variable is used to determine whether `AutoCastVariable`s are casted, and those\n  two functions run with a different thread. Note this only applies if one of\n  these two functions is called within `Layer.call`; if one of those two functions calls `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will still be casted.\n\n* `tf.data`:\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer` now takes a config tuple\n  instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to\n  `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer(dispatcher_config)`.\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer` now takes a config tuple instead\n  of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to  `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer(worker_config)`.\n\n* `tf.distribute`:\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_make_numpy_dataset`. Please use\n  `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` instead.\n  * Renames `experimental_hints` in `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to`,\n  `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`, `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_reduce`\n  to `options`.\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveHints` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`.\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveCommunication` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationImplementation`.\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function` to `distribute_datasets_from_function` as it is no longer experimental.\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_run_v2` method, which was deprecated in TF 2.2.\n\n* `tf.lite`:\n  * `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2` has been introduced, which updates the gradient definition for quantization which is outside the range\n     to be 0. To simulate the V1 the behavior of `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize(...)` use\n  `tf.grad_pass_through(tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2)(...)`.\n\n* Building TensorFlow:\n  * Windows platform builds: TensorFlow on Windows under MSVC is now built with\n  `--copt=/experimental:preprocessor --host_copt=/experimental:preprocessor`\n  (see `.bazelrc` for more details). Builds including TensorFlow may fail with\n  unexpected syntax errors if these flags are absent. See also\n  [this thread on SIG Build](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/g/build/c/LbAw8RILvTg/m/ttnuhYU2BgAJ).\n\n## Known Caveats\n  * `tf.keras.mixed_precision`\n    * When using mixed precision, calling `RMSprop.apply_gradients` or\n  `Nadam.apply_gradients` outside a `tf.function` does not work and will raise\n  the AttributeError \"Tensor.op is meaningless when eager execution is enabled\".\n  See this [issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/45536) for details and a workaround.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n### TF Core:\n  * Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy), which is a\n  NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. This module provides class\n  `ndarray`, which mimics the `ndarray` class in NumPy, and wraps an immutable\n  `tf.Tensor` under the hood. A subset of NumPy functions (e.g. `numpy.add`) are\n  provided. Their inter-operation with TF facilities is seamless in most cases.\n    See [tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md)\n    for details of what operations are supported and what are the differences\n  from NumPy.\n  * `tf.types.experimental.TensorLike` is a new `Union` type that can be used as\n  type annotation for variables representing a Tensor or a value\n    that can be converted to Tensor by `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\n  * Calling ops with a python constants or numpy values is now consistent with\n  tf.convert_to_tensor behavior. This avoids operations like\n    tf.reshape truncating inputs such as from int64 to int32.\n  * Adds `tf.sparse.map_values` to apply a function to the `.value`s of\n  `SparseTensor` arguments.\n  * The Python bitwise operators for `Tensor` (`__and__`, `__or__`, `__xor__` and `__invert__` now support non-`bool`\n  arguments and apply the corresponding bitwise ops. `bool` arguments continue\n  to be supported and dispatch to logical ops. This brings them more in line with\n  Python and NumPy behavior.\n  * Adds `tf.SparseTensor.with_values`. This returns a new SparseTensor with the same sparsity pattern, but with new provided values. It is\n    similar to the `with_values` function of `RaggedTensor`.\n  * Adds `StatelessCase` op, and uses it if none of case branches has stateful ops.\n  * Adds `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` to return total memory usage of the device.\n  * Adds gradients for `RaggedTensorToVariant` and `RaggedTensorFromVariant`.\n  * Improve shape inference of nested function calls by supporting constant\n  folding across Arg nodes which makes more static values available to shape\n  inference functions.\n* `tf.debugging`:\n  * `tf.debugging.assert_shapes()` now works on `SparseTensor`s (Fixes [#36268](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36268)).\n* GPU\n  * Adds Support for [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/)\n  on Ampere based GPUs.TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for\n  NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs which causes certain float32 ops, such as matrix\n  multiplications and convolutions, to run much faster on Ampere GPUs but with\n  reduced precision. This reduced precision has not been found to effect\n  convergence quality of deep learning models in practice. TensorFloat-32 is\n  enabled by default, but can be disabled with `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution`.\n* `tf.math`:\n  * Adds `tf.math.erfcinv`, the inverse to `tf.math.erfc`.\n* `tf.nn`:\n  *   `tf.nn.max_pool2d` now supports explicit padding.\n* `tf.image`:\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.stateless_random_*` functions for each\n  `tf.image.random_*` function. Added a new op `stateless_sample_distorted_bounding_box`\n  which is a deterministic version of `sample_distorted_bounding_box` op.\n  Given the same seed, these stateless functions/ops produce the same results\n  independent of how many times the function is called, and independent of global seed settings.\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.resize` backprop CUDA kernels for\n  `method=ResizeMethod.BILINEAR` (the default method). Enable by setting the environment\n  variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to `\"true\"` or `\"1\"`.\n* `tf.print`:\n  * Bug fix in `tf.print()` with `OrderedDict` where if an `OrderedDict`\n  didn't have the keys sorted, the keys and values were not being printed\n    in accordance with their correct mapping.\n* `tf.train.Checkpoint`:\n  * Now accepts a `root` argument in the initialization, which generates a\n  checkpoint with a root object. This allows users to create a `Checkpoint`\n  object that     is compatible with Keras `model.save_weights()` and\n  `model.load_weights`. The checkpoint is also compatible with the checkpoint\n  saved in the `variables/` folder in the SavedModel.\n  * When restoring, `save_path` can be a path to a SavedModel. The function will\n  automatically find the checkpoint in the SavedModel.\n\n### `tf.data`:\n  * Adds new `tf.data.experimental.service.register_dataset` and\n  `tf.data.experimental.service.from_dataset_id` APIs to enable one process to\n  register a dataset with the tf.data service, and another process to consume\n  data from the dataset.\n  * Adds support for dispatcher fault tolerance. To enable fault tolerance,\n  configure a `work_dir` when running your dispatcher server and set\n  `dispatcher_fault_tolerance=True`. The dispatcher will store its state to\n  `work_dir`, so that on restart it can continue from its previous state after restart.\n  * Adds support for sharing dataset graphs via shared filesystem instead of\n  over RPC. This reduces load on the dispatcher, improving performance\n    of distributing datasets. For this to work, the dispatcher's `work_dir`\n  must be accessible from workers. If the worker fails to read from the `work_dir`,\n  it falls back to using RPC for dataset graph transfer.\n  * Adds support for a new \"distributed_epoch\" processing mode.\n  This processing mode distributes a dataset across all tf.data workers,\n    instead of having each worker process the full dataset. See\n  [the tf.data service docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service#understand_processing_mode)\n  to learn more.\n  * Adds optional `exclude_cols` parameter to CsvDataset. This parameter is the\n  complement of `select_cols`; at most one of these should be specified.\n  * We have implemented an optimization which reorders data-discarding\n  transformations such as `take` and `shard` to happen earlier in the dataset\n  when it is safe to do so. The optimization can be disabled via the\n  `experimental_optimization.reorder_data_discarding_ops` dataset option.\n  * `tf.data.Options` were previously immutable and can now be overridden.\n  * `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` now supports Ragged and Sparse tensors with\n  a new `output_signature` argument, which allows `from_generator` to produce any\n  type describable by a `tf.TypeSpec`.\n  * `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` is now available in the core API as `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`.\n\n### `tf.distribute`:\n  * Introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of models via\n  `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`:\n    * Replaces the existing `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`\n  symbol with a new class that is for parameter server training in TF2. Usage of\n  the old symbol, usually with Estimator API, should be **replaced** with\n  [`tf.compat.v1.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`].\n    * Added `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.*` namespace, including the\n  main API `ClusterCoordinator` for coordinating the training cluster, the\n  related data structure `RemoteValue` and `PerWorkerValue`.\n  * `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy)\n  is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the major\n  improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please check out\n  the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worer training with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).\n  * Adds `tf.distribute.Strategy.gather` and `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_gather`\n  APIs to support gathering dense distributed values.\n  * Fixes various issues with saving a distributed model.\n\n### `tf.keras`:\n  * Improvements from the Functional API refactoring:\n    * Functional model construction does not need to maintain a global workspace\n  graph, removing memory leaks especially when building many models or very large models.\n    * Functional model construction should be ~8-10% faster on average.\n    * Functional models can now contain non-symbolic values in their call inputs\n  inside of the first positional argument.\n    * Several classes of TF ops that were not reliably converted to Keras layers\n  during functional API construction should now work, e.g.`tf.image.ssim_multiscale`\n    * Error messages when Functional API construction goes wrong (and when ops cannot be converted to Keras layers automatically) should be\n      clearer and easier to understand.\n  * `Optimizer.minimize` can now accept a loss `Tensor` and a `GradientTape`\n  as an alternative to accepting a `callable` loss.\n  * Adds `beta` hyperparameter to [FTRL](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Ftrl)\n  optimizer classes (Keras and others) to match [FTRL paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/41159.pdf).\n  * `Optimizer.__init__` now accepts a `gradient_aggregator` to allow for customization\n  of how gradients are aggregated across devices, as well as `gradients_transformers`\n  to allow for custom gradient transformations (such as gradient clipping).\n  * Improvements to Keras preprocessing layers:\n    * TextVectorization can now accept a vocabulary list or file as an init arg.\n    * Normalization can now accept mean and variance values as init args.\n  * In `Attention` and `AdditiveAttention` layers, the `call()` method now accepts a `return_attention_scores` argument. When set to\n    True, the layer returns the attention scores as an additional output argument.\n  * Adds `tf.metrics.log_cosh` and `tf.metrics.logcosh` API entrypoints with the\n  same implementation as their `tf.losses` equivalent.\n  * For Keras model, the individual call of `Model.evaluate` uses no cached data\n  for evaluation, while `Model.fit` uses cached data when `validation_data` arg\n  is provided for better performance.\n  * Adds a `save_traces` argument to `model.save`/ `tf.keras.models.save_model`\n  which determines whether the SavedModel format stores the Keras model/layer call\n  functions. The traced functions allow Keras to revive custom models and layers\n  without the original class definition, but if this isn't required the tracing\n  can be disabled with the added option.\n  * The `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API is now non-experimental.\n  The non-experimental API differs from the experimental API in several ways.\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy` no longer takes in a `tf.mixed_precision.\n  experimental.LossScale` in the constructor, and no longer has a `LossScale`\n  associated with it. Instead, `Model.compile` will automatically wrap the optimizer\n  with a `LossScaleOptimizer` using dynamic loss scaling if `Policy.name`\n  is \"mixed_float16\".\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`'s constructor takes in different\n  arguments. In particular, it no longer takes in a `LossScale`, and there is\n  no longer a `LossScale` associated with the `LossScaleOptimizer`. Instead,\n  `LossScaleOptimizer` directly implements fixed or dynamic loss scaling. See the\n  documentation of [`tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision/experimental/LossScaleOptimizer?version=nightly)\n  for details on the differences between the experimental `LossScaleOptimizer`\n  and the new non-experimental `LossScaleOptimizer`.\n    * `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` and its subclasses are\n  deprecated, as all of its functionality now exists within `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`\n\n### `tf.lite`:\n  * `TFLiteConverter`:\n    * Support optional flags `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type`\n  for full integer quantized models. This allows users to modify the model input\n  and output type to integer types (`tf.int8`, `tf.uint8`) instead of defaulting\n  to float type (`tf.float32`).\n  * NNAPI\n    * Adds NNAPI Delegation support for requantization use cases by converting\n  the operation into a dequantize-quantize pair.\n    * Removes deprecated `Interpreter.setUseNNAPI(boolean)` Java API. Use\n  `Interpreter.Options.setUseNNAPI` instead.\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API. Use `NnApiDelegate()`\n  and related delegate configuration methods directly.\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::SetAllowFp16PrecisionForFp32(bool)` C++ API.\n  Prefer controlling this via delegate options, e.g. `tflite::StatefulNnApiDelegate::Options::allow_fp16'\n  or `TfLiteGpuDelegateOptionsV2::is_precision_loss_allowed`.\n  * GPU\n    * GPU acceleration now supports quantized models by default\n  * `DynamicBuffer::AddJoinedString()` will now add a separator if the first string to be joined is empty.\n  *  Adds support for cumulative sum (cumsum), both as builtin op and MLIR conversion.\n\n### `TensorRT`\n  * Issues a warning when the `session_config` parameter for the TF1 converter\n  is used or the `rewrite_config_template` field in the TF2 converter parameter\n  object is used.\n\n### TPU Enhancements:\n  * Adds support for the `beta` parameter of the FTRL optimizer for TPU\n  embeddings. Users of other TensorFlow platforms can implement equivalent\n  behavior by adjusting the `l2` parameter.\n\n### XLA Support:\n  * xla.experimental.compile is deprecated, use `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` instead.\n  * Adds `tf.function.experimental_get_compiler_ir` which returns compiler IR\n  (currently 'hlo' and 'optimized_hlo') for given input for given function.\n\n### Security:\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior causing a segfault in `tf.raw_ops.Switch`,\n  ([CVE-2020-15190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15190))\n  * Fixes three vulnerabilities in conversion to DLPack format\n    * [CVE-2020-15191](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15191),\n    * [CVE-2020-15192](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15192),\n    * [CVE-2020-15193](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15193)\n  * Fixes two vulnerabilities in `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad`\n    * [CVE-2020-15194](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15194),\n    * [CVE-2020-15195](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15195)\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in `RaggedCountSparseOutput` and `SparseCountSparseOutput` operations\n    * [CVE-2020-15196](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15196),\n    * [CVE-2020-15197](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15197),\n    * [CVE-2020-15198](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15198),\n    * [CVE-2020-15199](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15199),\n    * [CVE-2020-15200](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15200),\n    * [CVE-2020-15201](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15201)\n  * Fixes an integer truncation vulnerability in code using the work sharder API,\n  ([CVE-2020-15202](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15202))\n  * Fixes a format string vulnerability in `tf.strings.as_string`,\n  ([CVE-2020-15203](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15203))\n  * Fixes segfault raised by calling session-only ops in eager mode,\n  ([CVE-2020-15204](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15204))\n  * Fixes data leak and potential ASLR violation from `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`,\n  ([CVE-2020-15205](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15205))\n  * Fixes segfaults caused by incomplete `SavedModel` validation,\n  ([CVE-2020-15206](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15206))\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to a bug in negative indexing support in TFLite,\n  ([CVE-2020-15207](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15207))\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to dimension mismatch in TFLite,\n  ([CVE-2020-15208](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15208))\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite saved model format\n    * [CVE-2020-15209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15209),\n    * [CVE-2020-15210](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15210),\n    * [CVE-2020-15211](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15211)\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite implementation of segment sum\n    * [CVE-2020-15212](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15212),\n    * [CVE-2020-15213](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15213),\n    * [CVE-2020-15214](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15214)\n  * Fixes a segfault in `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`,\n  ([CVE-2020-15265](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15265))\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior float cast causing a crash,\n  ([CVE-2020-15266](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15266))\n  * Fixes a lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatVecPermute` and\n  `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatDimMap` which can cause uninitialized memory access,\n  read outside bounds of arrays, data corruption and segmentation faults\n  ([CVE-2020-26267](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26267))\n  * Fixes a crash caused by writing to read only memory region\n  ([CVE-2020-26268](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26268))\n  * Fixes a heap out of bounds access in filesystem globbing implementation\n  ([CVE-2020-26269](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26269))\n\n### Other:\n  * We have replaced uses of \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" with \"allowlist\" and\n  \"denylist\" where possible.

breakage when compiling code that uses\n  both NumPy and TensorFlow headers.\n\n\n# Release 2.3.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n*   `tf.data` adds two new mechanisms to solve input pipeline bottlenecks and\n    save resources:\n\n    *   [snapshot](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/snapshot)\n    *   [tf.data service](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service).\n\n    In addition checkout the detailed\n    [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance_analysis) for\n    analyzing input pipeline performance with TF Profiler.\n\n*   [`tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/TPUStrategy)\n    is now a stable API and no longer considered experimental for TensorFlow.\n    (earlier `tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy`).\n\n*   [TF Profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) introduces two new\n    tools: a memory profiler to visualize your model\u2019s memory usage over time\n    and a [python tracer](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#events)\n    which allows you to trace python function calls in your model. Usability\n    improvements include better diagnostic messages and\n    [profile options](https://tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#collect_performance_data)\n    to customize the host and device trace verbosity level.\n\n*   Introduces experimental support for Keras Preprocessing Layers API\n    ([`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.*`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/experimental/preprocessing?version=nightly))\n    to handle data preprocessing operations, with support for composite tensor\n    inputs. Please see below for additional details on these layers.\n\n*   TFLite now properly supports dynamic shapes during conversion and inference.\n    We\u2019ve also added opt-in support on Android and iOS for\n    [XNNPACK](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/xnnpack),\n    a highly optimized set of CPU kernels, as well as opt-in support for\n    [executing quantized models on the GPU](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/performance/gpu_advanced.md#running-quantized-models-experimental).\n\n*   Libtensorflow packages are available in GCS starting this release. We have\n    also started to\n    [release a nightly version of these packages](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#official-builds).\n\n*   The experimental Python API\n    [`tf.debugging.experimental.enable_dump_debug_info()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/experimental/enable_dump_debug_info)\n    now allows you to instrument a TensorFlow program and dump debugging\n    information to a directory on the file system. The directory can be read and\n    visualized by a new interactive dashboard in TensorBoard 2.3 called\n    [Debugger V2](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/debugger_v2), which\n    reveals the details of the TensorFlow program including graph structures,\n    history of op executions at the Python (eager) and intra-graph levels, the\n    runtime dtype, shape, and numerical composition of tensors, as well as their\n    code locations.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n*   Increases the **minimum bazel version** required to build TF to **3.1.0**.\n*   `tf.data`\n    *   Makes the following (breaking) changes to the `tf.data`.\n    *   C++ API: - `IteratorBase::RestoreInternal`,\n        `IteratorBase::SaveInternal`, and `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState`\n        become pure-virtual and subclasses are now expected to provide an\n        implementation.\n    *   The deprecated `DatasetBase::IsStateful` method is removed in favor of\n        `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState`.\n    *   Deprecated overrides of `DatasetBase::MakeIterator` and\n        `MakeIteratorFromInputElement` are removed.\n    *   The signature of `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInternal` and\n        `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInput` has been extended with\n        `SerializationContext` argument to enable overriding the default policy\n        for the handling external state during iterator checkpointing. This is\n        not a backwards compatible change and all subclasses of `IteratorBase`\n        *need to be updated* accordingly.\n*   `tf.keras`\n    *   Add a new `BackupAndRestore` callback for handling distributed training\n        failures & restarts. Please take a look at this\n        [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras)\n        for details on how to use the callback.\n*   `tf.image.extract_glimpse` has been updated to correctly process the case\n    where `centered=False` and `normalized=False`. This is a breaking change as\n    the output is different from (incorrect) previous versions. Note this\n    breaking change only impacts `tf.image.extract_glimpse` and\n    `tf.compat.v2.image.extract_glimpse` API endpoints. The behavior of\n    `tf.compat.v1.image.extract_glimpse` does not change. The behavior of\n    existing C++ kernel `ExtractGlimpse` does not change either, so saved models\n    using `tf.raw_ops.ExtractGlimpse` will not be impacted.\n\n## Known Caveats\n  * `tf.lite`\n    * Keras-based LSTM models must be converted with an explicit batch size in the input layer.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n### TF Core:\n  * Set `tf2_behavior` to 1 to enable V2 for early loading cases.\n  * Add `execute_fn_for_device function` to dynamically choose the implementation based on underlying device placement.\n  * Eager:\n    * Add `reduce_logsumexp` benchmark with experiment compile.\n    * Give `EagerTensor`s a meaningful `__array__` implementation.\n    * Add another version of defun matmul for performance analysis.\n  * `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\n    * `AutoGraph` now includes into TensorFlow loops any variables that are closed over by local functions. Previously, such variables were sometimes incorrectly ignored.\n    * functions returned by the `get_concrete_function` method of `tf.function` objects can now be called with arguments consistent with the original arguments or type specs passed to `get_concrete_function`.  This calling convention is now the preferred way to use concrete functions with nested values and composite tensors. Please check the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/concrete_function) for more details on `concrete_ function`.\n    * Update `tf.function`'s `experimental_relax_shapes` to handle composite tensors appropriately.\n    * Optimize `tf.function` invocation, by removing redundant list converter.\n    * `tf.function` will retrace when called with a different variable instead of simply using the `dtype` & `shape`.\n    * [Improve support](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33862) for dynamically-sized TensorArray inside `tf.function`.\n  * `tf.math`:\n    * Narrow down `argmin`/`argmax` contract to always return the smallest index for ties.\n    * `tf.math.reduce_variance` and `tf.math.reduce_std` return correct computation for complex types and no longer support integer types.\n    * Add Bessel functions of order 0,1 to `tf.math.special`.\n    * `tf.divide` now always returns a tensor to be consistent with documentation and other APIs.\n  * `tf.image`:\n    * Replaced [`tf.image.non_max_suppression_padded`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/image/non_max_suppression_padded?hl=en) with a new implementation that supports batched inputs, which is considerably faster on TPUs and GPUs. Boxes with area=0 will be ignored. Existing usage with single inputs should still work as before.\n  * `tf.linalg`\n    * Add `tf.linalg.banded_triangular_solve`.\n  * `tf.random`:\n    * Add `tf.random.stateless_parameterized_truncated_normal`.\n  * `tf.ragged`:\n    * Add `tf.ragged.cross` and `tf.ragged.cross_hashed` operations.\n  * `tf.RaggedTensor`:\n    * `RaggedTensor.to_tensor()` now preserves static shape.\n    * Add `tf.strings.format()` and `tf.print()` to support RaggedTensors.\n  * `tf.saved_model`:\n    * `@tf.function` from SavedModel no longer ignores args after a `RaggedTensor` when selecting the concrete function to run.\n    * Fix save model issue for ops with a list of functions.\n    * Add `tf.saved_model.LoadOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/LoadOptions?hl=en) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for loading models and weights.\n    * Update `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/SaveOptions?hl=en) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for saving models and weights.\n    * Mutable tables now restore checkpointed values when loaded from SavedModel.\n    * The user object metadata field in the SavedModel proto has been deprecated as part of the updates to Keras SavedModel. Keras was the only consumer of this field prior to the update.\n  * GPU\n    * TF 2.3 includes PTX kernels only for [compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) 7.0 to reduce the TF pip binary size.  Earlier releases included PTX for a variety of older compute capabilities.\n    * Remove environmental variable `TF_USE_CUDNN`.\n  * Others\n    * Retain parent namescope for ops added inside `tf.while_loop`/`tf.cond`/`tf.switch_case`.\n    * Update `tf.vectorized_map` to support vectorizing `tf.while_loop` and TensorList operations.\n    * `tf.custom_gradient` can now be applied to functions that accept nested structures of `tensors` as inputs (instead of just a list of tensors). Note that Python structures such as tuples and lists now won't be treated as tensors, so if you still want them to be treated that way, you need to wrap them with `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\n    * No lowering on gradient case op when input is `DeviceIndex` op.\n    * Extend the ragged version of `tf.gather` to support `batch_dims` and `axis` args.\n    * Update `tf.map_fn` to support RaggedTensors and SparseTensors.\n    * Deprecate `tf.group`. It is not useful in eager mode.\n    * Add CPU and GPU implementation of modified variation of [`FTRL`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/ApplyFtrl)/[`FTRLV2`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/ApplyFtrlV2) that can triggerred by `multiply_linear_by_lr` allowing a learning rate of zero.\n\n### `tf.data`:\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` works correctly with tuples.\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` to output variable ragged rank.\n  * `tf.data.experimental.cardinality` is now a method on `tf.data.Dataset`.\n  * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports `len(Dataset)` when the cardinality is finite.\n\n### `tf.distribute`:\n  * Expose experimental [`tf.distribute.DistributedDataset`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedDataset?hl=en) and [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator) to distribute input data when using `tf.distribute` to scale training on multiple devices.\n    * Added a [`get_next_as_optional`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator?hl=en#get_next_as_optional) method for [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator?hl=en) class to return a `tf.experimental.Optional` instance that contains the next value for all replicas or none instead of raising an out of range error. Also see *new* [guide on input distribution](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input).\n  * Allow var.assign on MirroredVariables with aggregation=NONE in replica context. Previously this would raise an error. We now allow this because many users and library writers find using `.assign` in replica context to be more convenient, instead of having to use `Strategy.extended.update` which was the previous way of updating variables in this situation.\n  * `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` adds support for partial batches. Workers running out of data now continue to participate in the training with empty inputs, instead of raising an error. Learn more about [partial batches here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input#partial_batches).\n  * Improve the performance of reading metrics eagerly under `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\n  * Fix the issue that `strategy.reduce()` inside `tf.function` may raise exceptions when the values to reduce are from loops or if-clauses.\n  * Fix the issue that `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` cannot be used together with `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\n  * Add a `tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver.connect` API to simplify TPU initialization.\n  * Add `tf.distribute.Strategy.gather` and `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_gather` methods to gather and concatenate `tf.distribute.DistributedValues` across workers and devices.\n\n### `tf.keras`:\n  * Introduces experimental preprocessing layers API (`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing`)  to handle data preprocessing operations such as categorical feature encoding, text vectorization, data normalization, and data discretization (binning). The newly added layers provide a replacement for the  legacy feature column API, and support composite tensor inputs.\n  * Added **categorical data** processing layers:\n    * `IntegerLookup` & `StringLookup`: build an index of categorical feature values\n    * `CategoryEncoding`: turn integer-encoded categories into one-hot, multi-hot, or tf-idf encoded representations\n    * `CategoryCrossing`: create new categorical features representing co-occurrences of previous categorical feature values\n    * `Hashing`: the hashing trick, for large-vocabulary categorical features\n    * `Discretization`: turn continuous numerical features into categorical features by binning their values\n  * Improved **image preprocessing** layers: `CenterCrop`, `Rescaling`\n  * Improved **image augmentation** layers: `RandomCrop`, `RandomFlip`, `RandomTranslation`, `RandomRotation`, `RandomHeight`, `RandomWidth`, `RandomZoom`, `RandomContrast`\n  * Improved **`TextVectorization`** layer, which handles string tokenization, n-gram generation, and token encoding\n    * The `TextVectorization` layer now accounts for the mask_token as part of the vocabulary size when output_mode='int'. This means that, if you have a max_tokens value of 5000, your output will have 5000 unique values (not 5001 as before).\n    * Change the return value of `TextVectorization.get_vocabulary()` from `byte` to `string`. Users who previously were calling 'decode' on the output of this method should no longer need to do so.\n  * Introduce new Keras dataset generation utilities :\n    * **[`image_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image_dataset_from_directory)** is a utility based on `tf.data.Dataset`, meant to replace the legacy `ImageDataGenerator`. It takes you from a structured directory of images to a labeled dataset, in one function call. Note that it doesn't perform image data augmentation (which is meant to be done using preprocessing layers).\n    * **[`text_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text_dataset_from_directory)** takes you from a structured directory of text files to a labeled dataset, in one function call.\n    * **[`timeseries_dataset_from_array`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/timeseries_dataset_from_array)** is a `tf.data.Dataset`-based replacement of the legacy `TimeseriesGenerator`. It takes you from an array of timeseries data to a dataset of shifting windows with their targets.\n  * Added [`experimental_steps_per_execution`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?hl=en#compile)\n arg to `model.compile` to indicate the number of batches to run per `tf.function` call. This can speed up Keras Models on TPUs up to 3x.\n  * Extends `tf.keras.layers.Lambda` layers to support multi-argument lambdas, and keyword arguments when calling the layer.\n  * Functional models now get constructed if *any* tensor in a layer call's arguments/keyword arguments comes from a keras input. Previously the functional api would only work if all of the elements in the first argument to the layer came from a keras input.\n  * Clean up `BatchNormalization` layer's `trainable` property to act like standard python state when it's used inside `tf.functions` (frozen at tracing time), instead of acting like a pseudo-variable whose updates *kind of sometimes* get reflected in already-traced `tf.function` traces.\n  * Add the `Conv1DTranspose` layer.\n  * Refine the semantics of `SensitivitySpecificityBase` derived metrics. See the updated API docstrings for [`tf.keras.metrics.SensitivityAtSpecificity`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/SensitivityAtSpecificity) and [`tf.keras.metrics.SpecificityAtSensitivty`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/SpecificityAtSensitivity).\n\n### `tf.lite`:\n  * Converter\n      * Restored `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` flags in TF 2.x TFLiteConverter (backward compatible with TF 1.x) to support integer (tf.int8, tf.uint8) input and output types in post training full integer quantized models.\n      * Added support for converting and resizing models with dynamic (placeholder) dimensions. Previously, there was only limited support for dynamic batch size, and even that did not guarantee that the model could be properly resized at runtime.\n       * Enabled experimental support for a new quantization mode with 16-bit activations and 8-bit weights. See `lite.OpsSet.EXPERIMENTAL_TFLITE_BUILTINS_ACTIVATIONS_INT16_WEIGHTS_INT8`.\n  * CPU\n      * Fix an issue w/ dynamic weights and `Conv2D` on x86.\n      * Add a runtime Android flag for enabling `XNNPACK` for optimized CPU performance.\n      * Add a runtime iOS flag for enabling `XNNPACK` for optimized CPU performance.\n      * Add a compiler flag to enable building a TFLite library that applies `XNNPACK` delegate automatically when the model has a `fp32` operation.\n  * GPU\n      * Allow GPU acceleration starting with internal graph nodes\n      * Experimental support for quantized models with the Android GPU delegate\n      * Add GPU delegate whitelist.\n      * Rename GPU whitelist -> compatibility (list).\n      * Improve GPU compatibility list entries from crash reports.\n  * NNAPI\n      * Set default value for `StatefulNnApiDelegate::Options::max_number_delegated_partitions` to 3.\n      * Add capability to disable `NNAPI` CPU and check `NNAPI` Errno.\n      * Fix crashes when using `NNAPI` with target accelerator specified with model containing Conv2d or FullyConnected or LSTM nodes with quantized weights.\n      * Fix `ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA` execution failures with `sum`/`max`/`min`/`reduce` operations with `scalar` inputs.\n  * Hexagon\n      * TFLite Hexagon Delegate out of experimental.\n      * Experimental `int8` support for most hexagon ops.\n      * Experimental per-channel quant support for `conv` in Hexagon delegate.\n      * Support dynamic batch size in C++ API.\n  * CoreML\n     * Opensource CoreML delegate\n  * Misc\n      * Enable building Android TFLite targets on Windows\n      * Add support for `BatchMatMul`.\n      * Add support for `half_pixel_centers` with `ResizeNearestNeighbor`.\n      * Add 3D support for `BatchToSpaceND`.\n      * Add 5D support for `BroadcastSub`, `Maximum`, `Minimum`, `Transpose` and `BroadcastDiv`.\n      * Rename `kTfLiteActRelu1` to `kTfLiteActReluN1To1`.\n      * Enable flex delegate on tensorflow.lite.Interpreter Python package.\n      * Add `Buckettize`, `SparseCross` and `BoostedTreesBucketize` to the flex whitelist.\n      * Add support for selective registration of flex ops.\n      * Add missing kernels for flex delegate whitelisted ops.\n      * Fix issue when using direct `ByteBuffer` inputs with graphs that have dynamic shapes.\n      * Fix error checking supported operations in a model containing `HardSwish`.\n\n### Packaging Support\n  * Added `tf.sysconfig.get_build_info()`. Returns a dict that describes the build environment of the currently installed TensorFlow package, e.g. the NVIDIA CUDA and NVIDIA CuDNN versions used when TensorFlow was built.\n\n### Profiler\n  * Fix a subtle use-after-free issue in `XStatVisitor::RefValue()`.\n\n### TPU Enhancements\n  * Adds 3D mesh support in TPU configurations ops.\n  * Added TPU code for `FTRL` with `multiply_linear_by_lr`.\n  * Silently adds a new file system registry at `gstpu`.\n  * Support `restartType` in cloud tpu client.\n  * Depend on a specific version of google-api-python-client.\n  * Fixes apiclient import.\n\n### Tracing and Debugging\n  * Add a `TFE_Py_Execute` traceme.\n\n### XLA Support\n  * Implement stable `argmin` and `argmax`\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n902449@58880@bigcat_chen@ASIC, Abdul Baseer Khan, Abhineet Choudhary, Abolfazl Shahbazi, Adam Hillier, ag.ramesh, Agoniii, Ajay P, Alex Hoffman, Alexander Bayandin, Alexander Grund, Alexandre Abadie, Alexey Rogachevskiy, amoitra, Andrew Stevens, Angus-Luo, Anshuman Tripathy, Anush Elangovan, Artem Mavrin, Ashutosh Hathidara, autoih, Ayushman Kumar, ayushmankumar7, Bairen Yi, Bas Aarts, Bastian Eichenberger, Ben Barsdell, bhack, Bharat Raghunathan, Biagio Montaruli, Bigcat-Himax, blueyi, Bryan Cutler, Byambaa, Carlos Hernandez-Vaquero, Chen Lei, Chris Knorowski, Christian Clauss, chuanqiw, CuiYifeng, Daniel Situnayake, Daria Zhuravleva, Dayananda-V, Deven Desai, Devi Sandeep Endluri, Dmitry Zakharov, Dominic Jack, Duncan Riach, Edgar Liberis, Ehsan Toosi, ekuznetsov139, Elena Zhelezina, Eugene Kuznetsov, Eugene Mikhantiev, Evgenii Zheltonozhskii, Fabio Di Domenico, Fausto Morales, Fei Sun, feihugis, Felix E.

Because all images now use Python 3, Docker tags containing `-py3` will no longer be provided and existing `-py3` tags like `latest-py3` will not be updated.\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* Replaced the scalar type for string tensors from `std::string` to `tensorflow::tstring` which is now ABI stable.\n* A new Profiler for TF 2 for CPU/GPU/TPU. It offers both device and host performance analysis, including input pipeline and TF Ops. Optimization advisory is provided whenever possible. Please see [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_profiling_keras) and [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) for usage guidelines.\n* Export C++ functions to Python using `pybind11` as opposed to `SWIG` as a part of our [deprecation of swig efforts](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190208-pybind11.md).\n* `tf.distribute`:\n  * Support added for global sync `BatchNormalization` by using the newly added `tf.keras.layers.experimental.SyncBatchNormalization` layer. This layer will sync `BatchNormalization` statistics every step across all replicas taking part in sync training.\n  * Performance improvements for GPU multi-worker distributed training using `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`\n    * Update NVIDIA `NCCL` to `2.5.7-1` for better performance and performance tuning. Please see [nccl developer guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-developer-guide/docs/env.html) for more information on this.\n    * Support gradient `allreduce` in `float16`. See this [example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/modeling/grad_utils.py) usage.\n    * Experimental support of [all reduce gradient packing](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/CollectiveHints) to allow overlapping gradient aggregation with backward path computation.\n    * Deprecated `experimental_run_v2` method for distribution strategies and renamed the method `run` as it is no longer experimental.\n    * Add CompositeTensor support for DistributedIterators. This should help prevent unnecessary function retracing and memory leaks.\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * `Model.fit` major improvements:\n     * You can now use custom training logic with `Model.fit` by overriding `Model.train_step`.\n     * Easily write state-of-the-art training loops without worrying about all of the features `Model.fit` handles for you (distribution strategies, callbacks, data formats, looping logic, etc)\n     * See the default [`Model.train_step`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1381fc8e15e22402417b98e3881dfd409998daea/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L540) for an example of what this function should look like. Same applies for validation and inference via `Model.test_step` and `Model.predict_step`.\n     * SavedModel uses its own `Model._saved_model_inputs_spec` attr now instead of\n       relying on `Model.inputs` and `Model.input_names`, which are no longer set for subclass Models.\n       This attr is set in eager, `tf.function`, and graph modes. This gets rid of the need for users to\n       manually call `Model._set_inputs` when using Custom Training Loops(CTLs).\n     * Dynamic shapes are supported for generators by calling the Model on the first batch we \"peek\" from the generator.\n       This used to happen implicitly in `Model._standardize_user_data`. Long-term, a solution where the\n       `DataAdapter` doesn't need to call the Model is probably preferable.\n  * The SavedModel format now supports all Keras built-in layers (including metrics, preprocessing layers, and stateful RNN layers)\n  * Update Keras batch normalization layer to use the running mean and average computation in the `fused_batch_norm`. You should see significant performance improvements when using `fused_batch_norm` in Eager mode.\n\n* `tf.lite`:\n  * Enable TFLite experimental new converter by default.\n* XLA\n  * XLA now builds and works on windows. All prebuilt packages come with XLA available.\n  * XLA can be [enabled for a `tf.function`](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla#explicit_compilation_with_tffunction\n) with \u201ccompile or throw exception\u201d semantics on CPU and GPU.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * In `tf.keras.applications` the name of the \"top\" layer has been standardized to \"predictions\". This is only a problem if your code relies on the exact name of the layer.\n  * Huber loss function has been updated to be consistent with other Keras losses. It now computes mean over the last axis of per-sample losses before applying the reduction function.\n* AutoGraph no longer converts functions passed to `tf.py_function`, `tf.py_func` and `tf.numpy_function`.\n* Deprecating `XLA_CPU` and `XLA_GPU` devices with this release.\n* Increasing the minimum bazel version to build TF to 2.0.0 to use Bazel's `cc_experimental_shared_library`.\n* Keras compile/fit behavior for functional and subclassed models have been unified. Model properties such as `metrics`, `metrics_names` will now be available only after **training/evaluating the model on actual data** for functional models. `metrics` will **now include** model `loss` and output losses.`loss_functions` property has been removed from the model. This was an undocumented property that was accidentally public and has now been removed.\n\n## Known Caveats\n* The current TensorFlow release now **requires** [gast](https://pypi.org/project/gast/) version 0.3.3.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   `tf.data`:\n    *   Removed `autotune_algorithm` from experimental optimization options.\n*   TF Core:\n    *   `tf.constant` always creates CPU tensors irrespective of the current\n        device context.\n    *   Eager `TensorHandles` maintain a list of mirrors for any copies to local\n        or remote devices. This avoids any redundant copies due to op execution.\n    *   For `tf.Tensor` & `tf.Variable`, `.experimental_ref()` is no longer\n        experimental and is available as simply `.ref()`.\n    *   `pfor/vectorized_map`: Added support for vectorizing 56 more ops.\n        Vectorizing `tf.cond` is also supported now.\n    *   Set as much partial shape as we can infer statically within the gradient\n        impl of the gather op.\n    *   Gradient of `tf.while_loop` emits `StatelessWhile` op if `cond` and body\n        functions are stateless. This allows multiple gradients while ops to run\n        in parallel under distribution strategy.\n    *   Speed up `GradientTape` in eager mode by auto-generating list of op\n        inputs/outputs which are unused and hence not cached for gradient\n        functions.\n    *   Support `back_prop=False` in `while_v2` but mark it as deprecated.\n    *   Improve error message when attempting to use `None` in data-dependent\n        control flow.\n    *   Add `RaggedTensor.numpy()`.\n    *   Update `RaggedTensor.__getitem__` to preserve uniform dimensions & allow\n        indexing into uniform dimensions.\n    *   Update `tf.expand_dims` to always insert the new dimension as a\n        non-ragged dimension.\n    *   Update `tf.embedding_lookup` to use `partition_strategy` and `max_norm`\n        when `ids` is ragged.\n    *   Allow `batch_dims==rank(indices)` in `tf.gather`.\n    *   Add support for bfloat16 in `tf.print`.\n*   `tf.distribute`:\n    *   Support `embedding_column` with variable-length input features for\n        `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\n*   `tf.keras`:\n    *   Added `experimental_aggregate_gradients` argument to\n        `tf.keras.optimizer.Optimizer.apply_gradients`. This allows custom\n        gradient aggregation and processing aggregated gradients in custom\n        training loop.\n    *   Allow `pathlib.Path` paths for loading models via Keras API.\n*   `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\n    *   AutoGraph is now available in `ReplicaContext.merge_call`,\n        `Strategy.extended.update` and `Strategy.extended.update_non_slot`.\n    *   Experimental support for shape invariants has been enabled in\n        `tf.function`. See the API docs for\n        `tf.autograph.experimental.set_loop_options` for additional info.\n    *   AutoGraph error messages now exclude frames corresponding to APIs\n        internal to AutoGraph.\n    *   Improve shape inference for `tf.function` input arguments to unlock more\n        Grappler optimizations in TensorFlow 2.x.\n    *   Improve automatic control dependency management of resources by allowing\n        resource reads to occur in parallel and synchronizing only on writes.\n    *   Fix execution order of multiple stateful calls to `experimental_run_v2`\n        in `tf.function`.\n    *   You can now iterate over `RaggedTensors` using a for loop inside\n        `tf.function`.\n*   `tf.lite`:\n    *   Migrated the `tf.lite` C inference API out of experimental into lite/c.\n    *   Add an option to disallow `NNAPI` CPU / partial acceleration on Android\n        10\n    *   TFLite Android AARs now include the C headers and APIs are required to\n        use TFLite from native code.\n    *   Refactors the delegate and delegate kernel sources to allow usage in the\n        linter.\n    *   Limit delegated ops to actually supported ones if a device name is\n        specified or `NNAPI` CPU Fallback is disabled.\n    *   TFLite now supports `tf.math.reciprocal1` op by lowering to `tf.div op`.\n    *   TFLite's unpack op now supports boolean tensor inputs.\n    *   Microcontroller and embedded code moved from experimental to main\n        TensorFlow Lite folder\n    *   Check for large TFLite tensors.\n    *   Fix GPU delegate crash with C++17.\n    *   Add 5D support to TFLite `strided_slice`.\n    *   Fix error in delegation of `DEPTH_TO_SPACE` to `NNAPI` causing op not to\n        be accelerated.\n    *   Fix segmentation fault when running a model with LSTM nodes using\n        `NNAPI` Delegate\n    *   Fix `NNAPI` delegate failure when an operand for Maximum/Minimum\n        operation is a scalar.\n    *   Fix `NNAPI` delegate failure when Axis input for reduce operation is a\n        scalar.\n    *   Expose option to limit the number of partitions that will be delegated\n        to `NNAPI`.\n    *   If a target accelerator is specified, use its feature level to determine\n        operations to delegate instead of SDK version.\n*   `tf.random`:\n    *   Various random number generation improvements:\n    *   Add a fast path for default `random_uniform`\n    *   `random_seed` documentation improvement.\n    *   `RandomBinomial` broadcasts and appends the sample shape to the left\n        rather than the right.\n    *   Added `tf.random.stateless_binomial`, `tf.random.stateless_gamma`,\n        `tf.random.stateless_poisson`\n    *   `tf.random.stateless_uniform` now supports unbounded sampling of `int`\n        types.\n*   Math and Linear Algebra:\n    *   Add `tf.linalg.LinearOperatorTridiag`.\n    *   Add `LinearOperatorBlockLowerTriangular`\n    *   Add broadcasting support to\n        tf.linalg.triangular_solve[#26204](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26204),\n        tf.math.invert_permutation.\n    *   Add `tf.math.sobol_sample` op.\n    *   Add `tf.math.xlog1py`.\n    *   Add `tf.math.special.{dawsn,expi,fresnel_cos,fresnel_sin,spence}`.\n    *   Add a Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) and its inverse to\n        `tf.signal`.\n*   TPU Enhancements:\n    *   Refactor `TpuClusterResolver` to move shared logic to a separate pip\n        package.\n    *   Support configuring TPU software version from cloud tpu client.\n    *   Allowed TPU embedding weight decay factor to be multiplied by learning\n        rate.\n*   XLA Support:\n    *   Add standalone XLA AOT runtime target + relevant .cc sources to pip\n        package.\n    *   Add check for memory alignment to MemoryAllocation::MemoryAllocation()\n        on 32-bit ARM. This ensures a deterministic early exit instead of a hard\n        to debug bus error later.\n    *   `saved_model_cli aot_compile_cpu` allows you to compile saved models to\n        XLA header+object files and include them in your C++ programs.\n    *   Enable `Igamma`, `Igammac` for XLA.\n*   Deterministic Op Functionality:\n    *   XLA reduction emitter is deterministic when the environment variable\n        `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` is set to \"true\" or \"1\". This extends\n        deterministic `tf.nn.bias_add` back-prop functionality (and therefore\n        also deterministic back-prop of bias-addition in Keras layers) to\n        include when XLA JIT compilation is enabled.\n    *   Fix problem, when running on a CUDA GPU and when either environment\n        variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` or environment variable\n        `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC` is set to \"true\" or \"1\", in which some layer\n        configurations led to an exception with the message \"No algorithm\n        worked!\"\n*   Tracing and Debugging:\n    *   Add source, destination name to `_send` traceme to allow easier\n        debugging.\n    *   Add traceme event to `fastpathexecute`.\n*   Other:\n    *   Fix an issue with AUC.reset_states for multi-label AUC\n        [#35852](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35852)\n    *   Fix the TF upgrade script to not delete files when there is a parsing\n        error and the output mode is `in-place`.\n    *   Move `tensorflow/core:framework/*_pyclif` rules to\n        `tensorflow/core/framework:*_pyclif`.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n372046933, 8bitmp3, aaronhma, Abin Shahab, Aditya Patwardhan, Agoniii, Ahti Kitsik, Alan Yee, Albin Joy, Alex Hoffman, Alexander Grund, Alexandre E.

Python 2 support [officially ends an January 1, 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update). [As announced earlier](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/announce/gVwS5RC8mds/dCt1ka2XAAAJ), TensorFlow will also stop supporting Python 2 starting January 1, 2020, and no more releases are expected in 2019.\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n*   The `tensorflow` pip package now includes GPU support by default (same as\n    `tensorflow-gpu`) for both Linux and Windows. This runs on machines with and\n    without NVIDIA GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` is still available, and CPU-only\n    packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned\n    about package size.\n*   **Windows users:** Officially-released `tensorflow` Pip packages are now\n    built with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 in order to take advantage of the\n    new `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` compiler flag. To use these new\n    packages, you must install \"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual\n    Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019\", available from Microsoft's website\n    [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).\n    *   This does not change the minimum required version for building\n        TensorFlow from source on Windows, but builds enabling\n        `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` can take over 48 hours to compile without this\n        flag. Refer to `configure.py` for more information about\n        `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` and `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions`.\n    *   If either of the required DLLs, `msvcp140.dll` (old) or `msvcp140_1.dll`\n        (new), are missing on your machine, `import tensorflow` will print a\n        warning message.\n*   The `tensorflow` pip package is built with CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6.\n*   `tf.keras`\n    *   Experimental support for mixed precision is available on GPUs and Cloud\n        TPUs. See\n        [usage guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/mixed_precision).\n    *   Introduced the `TextVectorization` layer, which takes as input raw\n        strings and takes care of text standardization, tokenization, n-gram\n        generation, and vocabulary indexing. See this\n        [end-to-end text classification example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RvCnR7h0_l4Ekn5vINWToI9TNJdpUZB3).\n    *   Keras `.compile` `.fit` `.evaluate` and `.predict` are allowed to be\n        outside of the DistributionStrategy scope, as long as the model was\n        constructed inside of a scope.\n    *   Experimental support for Keras `.compile`, `.fit`, `.evaluate`, and\n        `.predict` is available for Cloud TPUs, Cloud TPU, for all types of\n        Keras models (sequential, functional and subclassing models).\n    *   Automatic outside compilation is now enabled for Cloud TPUs. This allows\n        `tf.summary` to be used more conveniently with Cloud TPUs.\n    *   Dynamic batch sizes with DistributionStrategy and Keras are supported on\n        Cloud TPUs.\n    *   Support for `.fit`, `.evaluate`, `.predict` on TPU using numpy data, in\n        addition to `tf.data.Dataset`.\n    *   Keras reference implementations for many popular models are available in\n        the TensorFlow\n        [Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official).\n*   `tf.data`\n    *   Changes rebatching for `tf.data datasets` + DistributionStrategy for\n        better performance. Note that the dataset also behaves slightly\n        differently, in that the rebatched dataset cardinality will always be a\n        multiple of the number of replicas.\n    *   `tf.data.Dataset` now supports automatic data distribution and sharding\n        in distributed environments, including on TPU pods.\n    *   Distribution policies for `tf.data.Dataset` can now be tuned with 1.\n        `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy(OFF, AUTO, FILE, DATA)` 2.\n        `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy(WARN, IGNORE, FAIL)`\n*   `tf.debugging`\n    *   Add `tf.debugging.enable_check_numerics()` and\n        `tf.debugging.disable_check_numerics()` to help debugging the root\n        causes of issues involving infinities and `NaN`s.\n*   `tf.distribute`\n    *   Custom training loop support on TPUs and TPU pods is available through\n        `strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset`,\n        `strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function`,\n        `strategy.experimental_run_v2`, `strategy.reduce`.\n    *   Support for a global distribution strategy through\n        `tf.distribute.experimental_set_strategy(),` in addition to\n        `strategy.scope()`.\n*   `TensorRT`\n    *   [TensorRT 6.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#tensorrt-whats-new)\n        is now supported and enabled by default. This adds support for more\n        TensorFlow ops including Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInputV2, AvgPool3D,\n        MaxPool3D, ResizeBilinear, and ResizeNearestNeighbor. In addition, the\n        TensorFlow-TensorRT python conversion API is exported as\n        `tf.experimental.tensorrt.Converter`.\n*   Environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` has been added. When set to\n    \"true\" or \"1\", this environment variable makes `tf.nn.bias_add` operate\n    deterministically (i.e. reproducibly), but currently only when XLA JIT\n    compilation is *not* enabled. Setting `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to \"true\" or\n    \"1\" also makes cuDNN convolution and max-pooling operate deterministically.\n    This makes Keras Conv\\*D and MaxPool\\*D layers operate deterministically in\n    both the forward and backward directions when running on a CUDA-enabled GPU.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n* Deletes `Operation.traceback_with_start_lines` for which we know of no usages.\n* Removed `id` from `tf.Tensor.__repr__()` as `id` is not useful other than internal debugging.\n* Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the `session.run()`. This only changes behavior when the graph execution would have resulted in an error. When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\n* The following APIs are not longer experimental: `tf.config.list_logical_devices`, `tf.config.list_physical_devices`, `tf.config.get_visible_devices`, `tf.config.set_visible_devices`, `tf.config.get_logical_device_configuration`, `tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration`.\n* `tf.config.experimentalVirtualDeviceConfiguration` has been renamed to `tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration`.\n* `tf.config.experimental_list_devices` has been removed, please use\n`tf.config.list_logical_devices`.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* `tf.data`\n  * Fixes concurrency issue with `tf.data.experimental.parallel_interleave` with `sloppy=True`.\n  * Add `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch()`.\n  * Extend `tf.data` parsing ops to support `RaggedTensors`.\n* `tf.distribute`\n  * Fix issue where GRU would crash or give incorrect output when a `tf.distribute.Strategy` was used.\n* `tf.estimator`\n  * Added option in `tf.estimator.CheckpointSaverHook` to not save the `GraphDef`.\n  * Moving the checkpoint reader from swig to pybind11.\n* `tf.keras`\n  * Export `depthwise_conv2d` in `tf.keras.backend`.\n  * In Keras Layers and Models, Variables in `trainable_weights`, `non_trainable_weights`, and `weights` are explicitly deduplicated.\n  * Keras `model.load_weights` now accepts `skip_mismatch` as an argument.

Note that `Model.fit_generator`, `Model.evaluate_generator`, and `Model.predict_generator` are deprecated endpoints. They are subsumed by `Model.fit`, `Model.evaluate`, and `Model.predict` which now support generators and Sequences.\n* `tf.lite`\n  * Legalization for `NMS` ops in TFLite.\n  * add `narrow_range` and `axis` to `quantize_v2` and `dequantize` ops.\n  * Added support for `FusedBatchNormV3` in converter.\n  * Add an `errno`-like field to `NNAPI` delegate for detecting `NNAPI` errors for fallback behaviour.\n  * Refactors `NNAPI` Delegate to support detailed reason why an operation is not accelerated.\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\n* Other\n  * Critical stability updates for TPUs, especially in cases where the XLA compiler produces compilation errors.\n  * TPUs can now be re-initialized multiple times, using `tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system`.\n  * Add `RaggedTensor.merge_dims()`.\n  * Added new `uniform_row_length` row-partitioning tensor to `RaggedTensor`.\n  * Add `shape` arg to `RaggedTensor.to_tensor`; Improve speed of `RaggedTensor.to_tensor`.\n  * `tf.io.parse_sequence_example` and `tf.io.parse_single_sequence_example` now support ragged features.\n  * Fix `while_v2` with variables in custom gradient.\n  * Support taking gradients of V2 `tf.cond` and `tf.while_loop` using `LookupTable`.\n  * Fix bug where `vectorized_map` failed on inputs with unknown static shape.\n  * Add preliminary support for sparse CSR matrices.\n  * Tensor equality with `None` now behaves as expected.\n  * Make calls to `tf.function(f)()`, `tf.function(f).get_concrete_function` and `tf.function(f).get_initialization_function` thread-safe.\n  * Extend `tf.identity` to work with CompositeTensors (such as SparseTensor)\n  * Added more `dtypes` and zero-sized inputs to `Einsum` Op and improved its performance\n  * Enable multi-worker `NCCL` `all-reduce` inside functions executing eagerly.\n  * Added complex128 support to `RFFT`, `RFFT2D`, `RFFT3D`, `IRFFT`, `IRFFT2D`, and `IRFFT3D`.\n  * Add `pfor` converter for `SelfAdjointEigV2`.\n  * Add `tf.math.ndtri` and `tf.math.erfinv`.\n  * Add `tf.config.experimental.enable_mlir_bridge` to allow using MLIR compiler bridge in eager model.\n  * Added support for MatrixSolve on Cloud TPU / XLA.\n  * Added `tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator` for forward-mode autodiff\n  * Add `LinearOperatorPermutation`.\n  * A few performance optimizations on `tf.reduce_logsumexp`.\n  * Added multilabel handling to `AUC` metric\n  * Optimization on `zeros_like`.\n  * Dimension constructor now requires `None` or types with an `__index__` method.\n  * Add `tf.random.uniform` microbenchmark.\n  * Use `_protogen` suffix for proto library targets instead of `_cc_protogen` suffix.\n  * Moving the checkpoint reader from `swig` to `pybind11`.\n  * `tf.device` & `MirroredStrategy` now supports passing in a `tf.config.LogicalDevice`\n  * If you're building Tensorflow from source, consider using [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) to automatically download and use the correct Bazel version. Bazelisk reads the `.bazelversion` file at the root of the project directory.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n8bitmp3, Aaron Ma, Abd\u00fcLhamit Yilmaz, Abhai Kollara, aflc, Ag Ramesh, Albert Z.

We do not expect to update the 1.x branch with features, although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year.\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n* As [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/developers/iRCt5m4qUz0), `tensorflow` pip package will by default include GPU support (same as `tensorflow-gpu` now) for the platforms we currently have GPU support (Linux and Windows). It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` will still be available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\n* TensorFlow 1.15 contains a complete implementation of the 2.0 API in its `compat.v2` module. It contains a copy of the 1.15 main module (without `contrib`) in the `compat.v1` module. TensorFlow 1.15 is able to emulate 2.0 behavior using the `enable_v2_behavior()` function.\nThis enables writing forward compatible code: by explicitly importing either `tensorflow.compat.v1` or `tensorflow.compat.v2`, you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of 1.15 or 2.0.\n* EagerTensor now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.\n* Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\n* Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\n* AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with `tf.data`, `tf.distribute` and `tf.keras` APIS.\n* Adds `enable_tensor_equality()`, which switches the behavior such that:\n  * Tensors are no longer hashable.\n  * Tensors can be compared with `==` and `!=`, yielding a Boolean Tensor with element-wise comparison results. This will be the default behavior in 2.0.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n* Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: `tensorflow_core` containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and `tensorflow` which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to `tensorflow_core` (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\n* TensorFlow 1.15 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config. To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel.\n  * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\n  * Layers now default to `float32`, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used `float64`, it will probably silently use `float32` in TensorFlow2, and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer \"layer-name\" is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\n  * Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time (i.e. when this Python line executes) if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the session.run(). When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* `tf.estimator`:\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint` format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\n  * Fix tests in canned estimators.\n  * Expose Head as public API.\n  * Fixes critical bugs that help with `DenseFeatures` usability in TF2\n* `tf.data`:\n  * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\n  * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to tf.train.Checkpoint format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\n  * Saving a Keras Model using `tf.saved_model.save` now saves the list of variables, trainable variables, regularization losses, and the call function.\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\n  * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\n  * Enable the Keras compile API `experimental_run_tf_function` flag by default. This flag enables single training/eval/predict execution path. With this 1. All input types are converted to `Dataset`. 2. When distribution strategy is not specified this goes through the no-op distribution strategy path. 3. Execution is wrapped in tf.function unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile.\n  * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\n* `tf.lite`\n  * Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\n  * tflite object detection script has a debug mode.\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\n  * Added evaluation script for COCO minival.\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\n* Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\n* `parallel_for`: Add converter for `MatrixDiag`.\n* Add `narrow_range` attribute to `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` and V3.\n* Added new op: `tf.strings.unsorted_segment_join`.\n* Add HW acceleration support for `topK_v2`.\n* Add new `TypeSpec` classes.\n* CloudBigtable version updated to v0.10.0.\n* Expose `Head` as public API.\n* Update docstring for gather to properly describe the non-empty `batch_dims` case.\n* Added `tf.sparse.from_dense` utility function.\n* Improved ragged tensor support in `TensorFlowTestCase`.\n* Makes the a-normal form transformation in Pyct configurable as to which nodes are converted to variables and which are not.\n* `ResizeInputTensor` now works for all delegates.\n* Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST:  expand_dims_test\n* `tf.cond` emits a StatelessIf op if the branch functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\n* `tf.cond`, `tf.while` and `if` and `while` in AutoGraph now accept a nonscalar predicate if has a single element. This does not affect non-V2 control flow.\n* `tf.while_loop` emits a StatelessWhile op if the cond and body functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\n* Refactors code in Quant8 LSTM support to reduce TFLite binary size.\n* Add support of local soft device placement for eager op.\n* Add HW acceleration support for `LogSoftMax`.\n* Added a function `nested_value_rowids` for ragged tensors.\n* Add guard to avoid acceleration of L2 Normalization with input rank != 4\n* Add `tf.math.cumulative_logsumexp operation`.\n* Add `tf.ragged.stack`.\n* Fix memory allocation problem when calling `AddNewInputConstantTensor`.\n* Delegate application failure leaves interpreter in valid state.\n* Add check for correct memory alignment to `MemoryAllocation::MemoryAllocation()`.\n* Extracts `NNAPIDelegateKernel` from nnapi_delegate.cc\n* Added support for `FusedBatchNormV3` in converter.\n* A ragged to dense op for directly calculating tensors.\n* Fix accidental quadratic graph construction cost in graph-mode `tf.gradients()`.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\na6802739, Aaron Ma, Abdullah Selek, Abolfazl Shahbazi, Ag Ramesh, Albert Z.

We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\n\n## Highlights\n\n*   TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train\n    models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential,\n    Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate\n    iteration and intuitive debugging, and `tf.data`, for building scalable\n    input pipelines. Checkout\n    [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional\n    details.\n*   Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the\n    [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy)\n    API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great\n    out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras\n    model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is\n    available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs.\n    Check out the\n    [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more\n    details.\n*   Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of\n    building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and\n    replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function`\n    decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed\n    remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\n*   Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use\n    `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public\n    API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\n*   AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions,\n    allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated\n    functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data,\n    tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs.\n*   Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem\n    projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow\n    Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from\n    SavedModels.\n*   API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument\n    names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and\n    clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of\n    all symbol changes can be found\n    [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0).\n    *   API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging`\n        in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\n*   No more global variables with helper methods like\n    `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\n*   Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()`\n    for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\n*   Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and\n    `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\n*   Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use\n    relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\n*   Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to\n    `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature\n    can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with\n    `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\n*   Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to \"true\" or \"1\"\n    forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling\n    algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself\n    is also deterministic.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n* Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\n* Toolchains:\n  * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\n  * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\n  Removed the `freeze_graph` command line tool; `SavedModel` should be used in place of frozen graphs.\n\n* `tf.contrib`:\n  * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\n  * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\n  * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py`.\n\n* `tf.estimator`:\n  * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\n  * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\n  * Canned Estimators don\u2019t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\n  * `Estimator.export_savedmodel` has been renamed to `export_saved_model`.\n  * When saving to SavedModel, Estimators will strip default op attributes. This is almost always the correct behavior, as it is more forwards compatible, but if you require that default attributes to be saved with the model, please use `tf.compat.v1.Estimator`.\n  * Feature Columns have been upgraded to be more Eager-friendly and to work with Keras. As a result, `tf.feature_column.input_layer` has been deprecated in favor of `tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures`. v1 feature columns have direct analogues in v2 except for `shared_embedding_columns`, which are not cross-compatible with v1 and v2. Use `tf.feature_column.shared_embeddings` instead.\n\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config.  To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel. HDF5 files are still supported.\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\n  * Layers now default to float32, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used float64, it will probably silently use float32 in TensorFlow 2, and a warning will be issued that starts with `Layer <layer-name>` is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\n\n* `tf.lite`:\n  * Removed `lite.OpHint`, `lite.experimental`, and `lite.constant` from 2.0 API.\n* Tensors are no longer hashable, but instead compare element-wise with `==` and `!=`. Use `tf.compat.v1.disable_tensor_equality()` to return to the previous behavior.\n* Performing equality operations on Tensors or Variables with incompatible shapes an exception is no longer thrown. Instead `__eq__` returns False and `__ne__` returns True.\n* Removed `tf.string_split` from v2 API.\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\n* Add `UnifiedGRU` as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the default recurrent activation function for GRU from `hard_sigmoid` to `sigmoid`, and `reset_after` to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is `hard_sigmoid` since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback to 1.x behavior.\n* `CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH`, `TENSORRT_INSTALL_PATH`, `NCCL_INSTALL_PATH`, `NCCL_HDR_PATH` are deprecated. Use `TF_CUDA_PATHS` instead which supports a comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA libraries and headers.\n\nRefer to our [public project status tracker](https://github.com/orgs/tensorflow/projects/4) and [issues tagged with `2.0`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A2.0) on GitHub for insight into recent issues and development progress.\n\nIf you experience any snags when using TF 2.0, please let us know at the [TF 2.0 Testing User Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/testing). We have a support mailing list as well as weekly testing meetings, and would love to hear your migration feedback and questions.\n\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   `tf.contrib`:\n\n    *   Expose `tf.contrib.proto.*` ops in `tf.io` (they will exist in TF2)\n\n*   `tf.data`:\n\n    *   Add support for TensorArrays to `tf.data Dataset`.\n    *   Integrate Ragged Tensors with `tf.data`.\n    *   All core and experimental tf.data transformations that input\n        user-defined functions can span multiple devices now.\n    *   Extending the TF 2.0 support for `shuffle(...,\n        reshuffle_each_iteration=True)` and `cache()` to work across different\n        Python iterators for the same dataset.\n    *   Removing the `experimental_numa_aware` option from `tf.data.Options`.\n    *   Add `num_parallel_reads` and passing in a Dataset containing filenames\n        into `TextLineDataset` and `FixedLengthRecordDataset`.\n    *   Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of\n        `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.enumerate_dataset` to core as\n        `tf.data.Dataset.enumerate`.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.unbatch` to core as\n        `tf.data.Dataset.unbatch`.\n    *   Adds option for introducing slack in the pipeline to reduce CPU\n        contention, via `tf.data.Options().experimental_slack = True`\n    *   Added experimental support for parallel batching to `batch()` and\n        `padded_batch()`. This functionality can be enabled through\n        `tf.data.Options()`.\n    *   Support cancellation of long-running `reduce`.\n    *   Now we use `dataset` node name as prefix instead of the op name, to\n        identify the component correctly in metrics, for pipelines with repeated\n        components.\n    *   Improve the performance of datasets using `from_tensors()`.\n    *   Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\n    *   Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and\n        `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\n\n*   `tf.distribute`:\n\n    *   Enable `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` working\n        in eager mode.\n    *   Callbacks are supported in `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\n    *   Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic\n        tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\n    *   Loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled w.r.t.\n        the global batch size when using a `tf.distribute.Strategy`.\n    *   Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss\n        scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO`\n        indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage\n        context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`.\n        When used in distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training\n        loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value\n        to be 'None' or 'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\n    *   Support for multi-host `ncclAllReduce` in Distribution Strategy.\n\n*   `tf.estimator`:\n\n    *   Replace `tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics` with\n        `tf.estimator.add_metrics`\n    *   Use `tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs` instead of `tf.estimator.inputs`\n    *   Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis\n        in early_s in Estimator\n    *   Canned Estimators will now use keras optimizers by default. An error\n        will be raised if tf.train.Optimizers are used, and you will have to\n        switch to tf.keras.optimizers or tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators.\n    *   A checkpoint converter for canned Estimators has been provided to\n        transition canned Estimators that are warm started from\n        `tf.train.Optimizers` to `tf.keras.optimizers`.\n    *   Losses are scaled in canned estimator v2 and not in the optimizers\n        anymore. If you are using Estimator + distribution strategy + optimikzer\n        v1 then the behavior does not change. This implies that if you are using\n        custom estimator with optimizer v2, you have to scale losses. We have\n        new utilities to help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`,\n        `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\n\n*   `tf.keras`:\n\n    *   Premade models (including Linear and WideDeep) have been introduced for\n        the purpose of replacing Premade estimators.\n    *   Model saving changes\n    *   `model.save` and `tf.saved_model.save` may now save to the TensorFlow\n        SavedModel format. The model can be restored using\n        `tf.keras.models.load_model`. HDF5 files are still supported, and may be\n        used by specifying `save_format=\"h5\"` when saving.\n    *   Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras\n        Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users\n        to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API.\n        Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable\n        creation or assign ops are not supported.\n    *   Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` argument in Keras\n        `compile`.\n    *   Add `tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell` as the preferred implementation\n        for RNN cells in TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cells with\n        custom behavior.\n    *   Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot when\n        using the TensorBoard callback.\n    *   Switched Keras `fit/evaluate/predict` execution to use only a single\n        unified path by default unless eager execution has been explicitly\n        disabled, regardless of input type. This unified path places an\n        eager-friendly training step inside of a `tf.function`. With this\n    *   All input types are converted to `Dataset`.\n    *   The path assumes there is always a distribution strategy. when\n        distribution strategy is not specified the path uses a no-op\n        distribution strategy.\n    *   The training step is wrapped in `tf.function` unless `run_eagerly=True`\n        is set in compile. The single path execution code does not yet support\n        all use cases. We fallback to the existing v1 execution paths if your\n        model contains the following:\n        1.  `sample_weight_mode` in compile\n        2.  `weighted_metrics` in compile\n        3.  v1 optimizer\n        4.  target tensors in compile If you are experiencing any issues because\n            of this change, please inform us (file an issue) about your use case\n            and you can unblock yourself by setting\n            `experimental_run_tf_function=False` in compile meanwhile. We have\n            seen couple of use cases where the model usage pattern is not as\n            expected and would not work with this change.\n    *   output tensors of one layer is used in the constructor of another.\n    *   symbolic tensors outside the scope of the model are used in custom loss\n        functions. The flag can be disabled for these cases and ideally the\n        usage pattern will need to be fixed.\n    *   Mark Keras `set_session` as `compat.v1` only.\n    *   `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to\n        `tf.train.Checkpoint format`, which allows the saved checkpoints to be\n        compatible with `model.load_weights`.\n    *   `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently,\n        `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing\n        implementation was fixed.\n    *   Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D`\n        and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor`\n        to store weights, allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\n    *   Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is\n        dataset/generator/keras sequence.\n    *   Update TF 2.0 `keras.backend.name_scope` to use TF 2.0 `name_scope`.\n    *   Add v2 module aliases for losses, metrics, initializers and optimizers:\n        `tf.losses = tf.keras.losses` & `tf.metrics = tf.keras.metrics` &\n        `tf.initializers = tf.keras.initializers` & `tf.optimizers =\n        tf.keras.optimizers`.\n    *   Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities.\n        Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross\n        entropy formula for probabilities.\n    *   Added public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\n    *   Add support for temporal sample weight mode in subclassed models.\n    *   Raise `ValueError` if an integer is passed to the training APIs.\n    *   Added fault-tolerance support for training Keras model via `model.fit()`\n        with `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, tutorial available.\n    *   Custom Callback tutorial is now available.\n    *   To train with `tf.distribute`, Keras API is recommended over estimator.\n    *   `steps_per_epoch` and `steps` arguments are supported with numpy arrays.\n    *   New error message when unexpected keys are used in\n        sample_weight/class_weight dictionaries\n    *   Losses are scaled in Keras compile/fit and not in the optimizers\n        anymore. If you are using custom training loop, we have new utilities to\n        help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`,\n        `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\n    *   `Layer` apply and add_variable APIs are deprecated.\n    *   Added support for channels first data format in cross entropy losses\n        with logits and support for tensors with unknown ranks.\n    *   Error messages will be raised if `add_update`, `add_metric`, `add_loss`,\n        activity regularizers are used inside of a control flow branch.\n    *   New loss reduction types:\n    *   `AUTO`: Indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the\n        usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to\n        `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used with `tf.distribute.Strategy`, outside\n        of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we\n        expect reduction value to be `SUM` or `NONE`. Using `AUTO` in that case\n        will raise an error.\n    *   `NONE`: Weighted losses with one dimension reduced (axis=-1, or axis\n        specified by loss function). When this reduction type used with built-in\n        Keras training loops like `fit`/`evaluate`, the unreduced vector loss is\n        passed to the optimizer but the reported loss will be a scalar value.\n    *   `SUM`: Scalar sum of weighted losses. 4. `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`: Scalar\n        `SUM` divided by number of elements in losses. This reduction type is\n        not supported when used with `tf.distribute.Strategy` outside of\n        built-in training loops like `tf.keras` `compile`/`fit`.\n    *   Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which\n        are not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All\n        losses will now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\n    *   `model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor)` should work in ambient eager.\n    *   Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in compile.\n        Affects following cases\n    *   When name is given as 'accuracy'/'crossentropy'\n    *   When an aliased function name is used eg. 'mse'\n    *   Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\n    *   Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\n    *   Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\n    *   Add v2 APIs for `AUCCurve` and `AUCSummationMethod` enums.\n    *   `add_update` can now be passed a zero-arg callable in order to support\n        turning off the update when setting `trainable=False` on a Layer of a\n        Model compiled with `run_eagerly=True`.\n    *   Standardize the LayerNormalization API by replacing the args `norm_axis`\n        and `params_axis` with `axis`.\n    *   Fixed critical bugs that help with DenseFeatures usability in TF2\n\n*   `tf.lite`:\n\n    *   Added evaluation script for `COCO` minival\n    *   Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\n    *   Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\n    *   Added support for TFLiteConverter Python API in 2.0. Contains functions\n        from_saved_model, from_keras_file, and from_concrete_functions.\n    *   Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST.\n    *   Add `narrow_range` attribute to QuantizeAndDequantizeV2 and V3.\n    *   Added support for `tflite_convert` command line tool in 2.0.\n    *   Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by\n        multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use\n        INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from\n        this version onwards.\n    *   Post-training quantization tool supports fp16 weights and GPU delegate\n        acceleration for fp16.\n    *   Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\n    *   Extracts `NNAPIDelegateKernel` from nnapi_delegate.cc\n\n*   TensorRT\n\n    *   Add TensorFlow 2.0-compatible `TrtGraphConverterV2` API for TensorRT\n        conversion. TensorRT initialization arguments are now passed wrapped in\n        a named-tuple, `TrtConversionParams`, rather than as separate arguments\n        as in `TrtGraphConverter`.\n    *   Changed API to optimize TensorRT engines during graph optimization. This\n        is now done by calling `converter.build()` where previously\n        `is_dynamic_op=False` would be set.\n    *   `converter.convert()` no longer returns a `tf.function`. Now the\n        function must be accessed from the saved model.\n    *   The `converter.calibrate()` method has been removed. To trigger\n        calibration, a `calibration_input_fn` should be provided to\n        `converter.convert()`.\n\n*   Other:\n\n    *   Fix accidental quadratic graph construction cost in graph-mode\n        `tf.gradients()`.\n    *   ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\n    *   ResourceVariable support for `gather_nd`.\n    *   `ResourceVariable` and `Variable` no longer accepts `constraint` in the\n        constructor, nor expose it as a @property.\n    *   Added gradient for `SparseToDense` op.\n    *   Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python\n        benchmarks.\n    *   `image.resize` in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\n    *   `image.resize` now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels\n        (incl. anti-aliasing).\n    *   Renamed `tf.image` functions to remove duplicate \"image\" where it is\n        redundant.\n    *   Variadic reduce is supported on CPU Variadic reduce is supported on CPU\n    *   Remove unused `StringViewVariantWrapper`.\n    *   Delete unused `Fingerprint64Map` op registration\n    *   Add broadcasting support to `tf.matmul`.\n    *   Add C++ Gradient for `BatchMatMulV2`.\n    *   Add `tf.math.cumulative_logsumexp` operation.\n    *   Add ellipsis (...) support for `tf.einsum()`.\n    *   Add expand_composites argument to all `nest.*` methods.\n    *   Added `strings.byte_split`.\n    *   Add a new \"result_type\" parameter to `tf.strings.split`.\n    *   Add name argument to `tf.string_split` and `tf.strings_split`.\n    *   Extend `tf.strings.split` to support inputs with any rank.\n    *   Added `tf.random.binomial`.\n    *   Added `key` and `skip` methods to `random.experimental.Generator`.\n    *   Extend `tf.function` with basic support for CompositeTensors arguments\n        (such as `SparseTensor` and `RaggedTensor`).\n    *   `parallel_for.pfor`: add converters for Softmax, LogSoftmax, IsNaN, All,\n        Any, and MatrixSetDiag.\n    *   `parallel_for`: add converters for LowerTriangularSolve and Cholesky.\n    *   `parallel_for`: add converters for `LogMatrixDeterminant` and\n        `MatrixBandPart`.\n    *   `parallel_for`: Add converter for `MatrixDiag`.\n    *   `parallel_for`: Add converters for `OneHot`, `LowerBound`, `UpperBound`.\n    *   `parallel_for`: add converter for `BroadcastTo`.\n    *   Add `pfor` converter for `Squeeze`.\n    *   Add `RaggedTensor.placeholder()`.\n    *   Add ragged tensor support to `tf.squeeze`.\n    *   Update RaggedTensors to support int32 row_splits.\n    *   Allow `LinearOperator.solve` to take a `LinearOperator`.\n    *   Allow all dtypes for `LinearOperatorCirculant`.\n    *   Introduce MaxParallelism method\n    *   Add `LinearOperatorHouseholder`.\n    *   Adds Philox support to new stateful RNG's XLA path.\n    *   Added `TensorSpec` support for CompositeTensors.\n    *   Added `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve` op.\n    *   Added partial_pivoting input parameter to `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve`.\n    *   Added gradient to `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve`.\n    *   Added `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_mul op`.\n    *   Added GPU implementation of `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_matmul`.\n    *   Added `LinearOperatorToeplitz`.\n    *   Upgraded LIBXSMM to version 1.11.\n    *   Uniform processing of quantized embeddings by Gather and EmbeddingLookup\n        Ops.\n    *   Correct a misstatement in the documentation of the sparse softmax cross\n        entropy logit parameter.\n    *   Add `tf.ragged.boolean_mask`.\n    *   `tf.switch_case` added, which selects a branch_fn based on a\n        branch_index.\n    *   The C++ kernel of gather op supports batch dimensions.\n    *   Fixed default value and documentation for `trainable` arg of\n        tf.Variable.\n    *   `EagerTensor` now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.\n    *   This change bumps the version number of the `FullyConnected` Op to 5.\n    *   Added new op: `tf.strings.unsorted_segment_join`.\n    *   Added HW acceleration support for `topK_v2`.\n    *   CloudBigtable version updated to v0.10.0 BEGIN_PUBLIC CloudBigtable\n        version updated to v0.10.0.\n    *   Expose `Head` as public API.\n    *   Added `tf.sparse.from_dense` utility function.\n    *   Improved ragged tensor support in `TensorFlowTestCase`.\n    *   Added a function `nested_value_rowids` for ragged tensors.\n    *   Added `tf.ragged.stack`.\n    *   Makes the a-normal form transformation in Pyct configurable as to which\n        nodes are converted to variables and which are not.\n    *   `ResizeInputTensor` now works for all delegates.\n    *   `tf.cond` emits a StatelessIf op if the branch functions are stateless\n        and do not touch any resources.\n    *   Add support of local soft device placement for eager op.\n    *   Pass partial_pivoting to the `_TridiagonalSolveGrad`.\n    *   Add HW acceleration support for `LogSoftMax`.\n    *   Add guard to avoid acceleration of L2 Normalization with input rank != 4\n    *   Fix memory allocation problem when calling `AddNewInputConstantTensor`.\n    *   Delegate application failure leaves interpreter in valid state\n    *   `tf.while_loop` emits a StatelessWhile op if the cond and body functions\n        are stateless and do not touch any resources.\n    *   `tf.cond`, `tf.while` and if and while in AutoGraph now accept a\n        nonscalar predicate if has a single element. This does not affect non-V2\n        control flow.\n    *   Fix potential security vulnerability where decoding variant tensors from\n        proto could result in heap out of bounds memory access.\n    *   Only create a GCS directory object if the object does not already exist.\n    *   Introduce `dynamic` constructor argument in Layer and Model, which\n        should be set to `True` when using imperative control flow in the `call`\n        method.\n    *   Begin adding Go wrapper for C Eager API.\n    *   XLA HLO graphs can be inspected with interactive_graphviz tool now.\n    *   Add dataset ops to the graph (or create kernels in Eager execution)\n        during the python Dataset object creation instead doing it during\n        Iterator creation time.\n    *   Add `batch_dims` argument to `tf.gather`.\n    *   The behavior of `tf.gather` is now correct when `axis=None` and\n        `batch_dims<0`.\n    *   Update docstring for gather to properly describe the non-empty\n        `batch_dims` case.\n    *   Removing of dtype in the constructor of initializers and partition_info\n        in call.\n    *   Add `tf.math.nextafter` op.\n    *   Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically\n        dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector\n        architecture. To disable them, build with\n        `--define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0`.\n    *   `tf.linspace(start, stop, num)` now always uses \"stop\" as last value\n        (for num > 1)\n    *   Added top-k to precision and recall to keras metrics.\n    *   Add a ragged size op and register it to the op dispatcher\n    *   Transitive dependencies on :`pooling_ops` were removed.

This module\n    is required to allow libraries to publish code which works in both 1.x and\n    2.x. After this release, no backwards incompatible changes are allowed in\n    the 2.0 Python API.\n*   Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically\n    dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture.\n    To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\n\n## Behavioral changes\n\n*   Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss\n    scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO`\n    indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context.\n    For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used in\n    distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training loops such as\n    `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be 'None' or\n    'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\n*   Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which are\n    not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All losses will\n    now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\n*   Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic\n    tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\n*   tf.linspace(start, stop, num) now always uses \"stop\" as last value (for\n    num > 1)\n*   `ResourceVariable` and `Variable` no longer accepts `constraint` in the\n    constructor, nor expose it as a @property.\n*   The behavior of tf.gather is now correct when axis=None and batch_dims<0.\n*   Only create a GCS directory object if the object does not already exist.\n*   In `map_vectorization` optimization, reduce the degree of parallelism in the\n    vectorized map node.\n*   Bug fix: loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled\n    w.r.t. the global batch size when using a tf.distribute.Strategy.\n*   Updating cosine similarity loss - removed the negate sign from cosine\n    similarity.\n*   DType is no longer convertible to an int. Use dtype.as_datatype_enum instead\n    of int(dtype) to get the same result.\n*   Changed default for gradient accumulation for TPU embeddings to true.\n*   Callbacks now log values in eager mode when a deferred build model is used.\n*   Transitive dependencies on :pooling_ops were removed. Some users may need to\n    add explicit dependencies on :pooling_ops if they reference the operators\n    from that library.\n*   tf.keras.optimizers default learning rate changes:\n    *   Adadelta: 1.000 to 0.001\n    *   Adagrad: 0.01 to 0.001\n    *   Adamax: 0.002 to 0.001\n    *   NAdam: 0.002 to 0.001\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   Documentation\n*   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n    *   Remove unused StringViewVariantWrapper\n    *   Delete unused Fingerprint64Map op registration\n    *   SignatureDef util functions have been deprecated.\n    *   Renamed tf.image functions to remove duplicate \"image\" where it is\n        redundant.\n    *   tf.keras.experimental.export renamed to\n        tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model\n    *   Standardize the LayerNormalization API by replacing the args `norm_axis`\n        and `params_axis` with `axis`.\n    *   Tensor::UnsafeCopyFromInternal deprecated in favor Tensor::BitcastFrom\n*   Keras & Python API\n    *   Add v2 module aliases for:\n    *   tf.initializers => tf.keras.initializers\n    *   tf.losses => tf.keras.losses & tf.metrics => tf.keras.metrics\n    *   tf.optimizers => tf.keras.optimizers\n    *   Add tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell as the preferred implementation of\n        RNN cell for TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cell with custom\n        behavior.\n    *   Adding `clear_losses` API to be able to clear losses at the end of\n        forward pass in a custom training loop in eager.\n    *   Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` param in Keras\n        `compile`.\n    *   Added top-k to precision and recall to keras metrics.\n    *   Adding public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\n    *   Fix: model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor) should work in ambient eager.\n    *   Add name argument to tf.string_split and tf.strings_split\n    *   Minor change to SavedModels exported from Keras using\n        tf.keras.experimental.export. (SignatureDef key for evaluation mode is\n        now \"eval\" instead of \"test\"). This will be reverted back to \"test\" in\n        the near future.\n    *   Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities.\n        Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross\n        entropy formula for probabilities.\n    *   Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras\n        Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users\n        to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API.\n        Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable\n        creation or assign ops are not supported.\n    *   Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot.\n    *   Introduce `dynamic` constructor argument in Layer and Model, which\n        should be set to True when using imperative control flow in the `call`\n        method.\n    *   Removing of dtype in the constructor of initializers and partition_info\n        in call.\n*   New ops and improved op functionality\n    *   Add OpKernels for some stateless maps\n    *   Add v2 APIs for AUCCurve and AUCSummationMethod\n        enums. #tf-metrics-convergence\n    *   Add tf.math.nextafter op.\n    *   Add CompositeTensor base class.\n    *   Add tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve op.\n    *   Add opkernel templates for common table operations.\n    *   Added support for TFLite in TensorFlow 2.0.\n    *   Adds summary trace API for collecting graph and profile information.\n    *   Add batch_dims argument to tf.gather.\n    *   Add support for `add_metric` in the graph function mode.\n    *   Add C++ Gradient for BatchMatMulV2.\n    *   Added tf.random.binomial\n    *   Added gradient for SparseToDense op.\n    *   Add legacy string flat hash map op kernels\n    *   Add a ragged size op and register it to the op dispatcher\n    *   Add broadcasting support to tf.matmul.\n    *   Add ellipsis (...) support for tf.einsum()\n    *   Added LinearOperator.adjoint and LinearOperator.H (alias).\n    *   Added GPU implementation of tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve.\n    *   Added strings.byte_split\n    *   Add RaggedTensor.placeholder()\n    *   Add a new \"result_type\" parameter to tf.strings.split\n    *   `add_update` can now be passed a zero-arg callable in order to support\n        turning off the update when setting `trainable=False` on a Layer of a\n        Model compiled with `run_eagerly=True`.\n    *   Add variant wrapper for absl::string_view\n    *   Add expand_composites argument to all nest.* methods.\n    *   Add pfor converter for Squeeze.\n    *   Bug fix for tf.tile gradient\n    *   Expose CriticalSection in core as tf.CriticalSection.\n    *   Update Fingerprint64Map to use aliases\n    *   ResourceVariable support for gather_nd.\n    *   ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\n    *   Variadic reduce is supported on CPU\n    *   Extend tf.function with basic support for CompositeTensors arguments\n        (such as SparseTensor and RaggedTensor).\n    *   Add templates and interfaces for creating lookup tables\n    *   Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by\n        multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use\n        INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from\n        this version onwards.\n    *   Malformed gif images could result in an access out of bounds in the\n        color palette of the frame. This has been fixed now\n    *   image.resize now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels\n        (incl. anti-aliasing).\n    *   Added an isotonic regression solver (tf.nn.isotonic_regression).\n*   Performance\n    *   Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically\n        dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector\n        architecture. To disable them, build with\n        --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\n    *   Support for multi-host ncclAllReduce in Distribution Strategy.\n    *   Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python\n        benchmarks.\n*   TensorFlow 2.0 Development\n    *   Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\n    *   Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\n    *   Add UnifiedGRU as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the\n        default recurrent activation function for GRU from 'hard_sigmoid' to\n        'sigmoid', and 'reset_after' to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent\n        activation is 'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new\n        unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is\n        using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well.\n        With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU\n        kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default\n        and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is\n        checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained\n        checkpoint, please construct the layer with\n        GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback\n        to 1.x behavior.\n    *   TF 2.0 - Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in\n        compile. Affects following cases 1. When name is given as\n        'accuracy'/'crossentropy' 2. When an aliased function name is used eg.\n        'mse' 3. Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\n    *   Begin adding Go wrapper for C Eager API\n    *   image.resize in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\n    *   removed tf.string_split from v2 API\n    *   Expose tf.contrib.proto.* ops in tf.io (they will exist in TF2)\n    *   \"Updates the TFLiteConverter API in 2.0. Changes from_concrete_function\n        to from_concrete_functions.\"\n    *   Enable tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy working in\n        eager mode.\n    *   Support both binary and -1/1 label input in v2 hinge and squared hinge\n        losses.\n*   TensorFlow Lite\n    *   \"Adds support for tflite_convert in 2.0.\"\n    *   \"Remove lite.OpHint, lite.experimental, and lite.constant from 2.0 API.\"\n*   tf.contrib\n    *   Added Neural Turing Implementation as described in\n        https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08518.\n    *   Remove tf.contrib.timeseries dependency on TF distributions.\n*   tf.data\n    *   Add num_parallel_reads and passing in a Dataset containing filenames\n        into TextLineDataset and FixedLengthRecordDataset\n    *   Going forward we operate in TF 2.0, this change is part of the effort to\n        slowly converting XYZDataset to DatasetV2 type which is the official\n        version going to be used in TF 2.0 and motivated by some compatibility\n        issue found, _BigtableXYZDataset (of type DatasetV2) does not implement\n        the _as_variant_tensor() of DatasetV1, when moving contrib.bigtable to\n        tensorflow_io. Converting into DatasetV2 removes the overheads to\n        maintain V1 while we are moving into TF 2.0.\n    *   Add dataset ops to the graph (or create kernels in Eager execution)\n        during the python Dataset object creation instead doing it during\n        Iterator creation time.\n    *   Add support for TensorArrays to tf.data Dataset.\n    *   Switching tf.data functions to use `defun`, providing an escape hatch to\n        continue using the legacy `Defun`.\n*   Toolchains\n    *   CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH, TENSORRT_INSTALL_PATH, NCCL_INSTALL_PATH,\n        NCCL_HDR_PATH are deprecated. Use TF_CUDA_PATHS instead which supports a\n        comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA\n        libraries and headers.\n    *   TF code now resides in `tensorflow_core` and `tensorflow` is just a\n        virtual pip package.

This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n* TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n* Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n* Moved NCCL to core.\n\n## Behavioral changes\n\n* Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n* Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   Documentation\n    *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n        quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n    *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n        using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n        portable to all platforms.\n*   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n    *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n        `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n        `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n        `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n        `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n        `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n        `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n    *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n    *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n        `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n        `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n    *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n        tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n    *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n    *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n        `Dataset.range`.\n    *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n        `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n    *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n        endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n        and `tf.version.`. Moving all constants under `tf.saved_model`\n        submodules to `tf.saved_model` module. New endpoints are added in V1 and\n        V2 but existing endpoint removals are only applied in V2.\n    *   Deprecates behavior where device assignment overrides collocation\n        constraints inside a collocation context manager.\n*   Keras & Python API\n    *   Add to Keras functionality analogous to\n        `tf.register_tensor_conversion_function`.\n    *   Subclassed Keras models can now be saved through\n        `tf.contrib.saved_model.save_keras_model`.\n    *   `LinearOperator.matmul` now returns a new `LinearOperator`.\n*   New ops and improved op functionality\n    *   Add a Nearest Neighbor Resize op.\n    *   Add an `ignore_unknown` argument to `parse_values` which suppresses\n        ValueError for unknown hyperparameter types. Such * Add\n        `tf.linalg.matvec` convenience function.\n    *   `tf.einsum()`raises `ValueError` for unsupported equations like\n        `\"ii->\"`.\n    *   Add DCT-I and IDCT-I in `tf.signal.dct` and `tf.signal.idct`.\n    *   Add LU decomposition op.\n    *   Add quantile loss to gradient boosted trees in estimator.\n    *   Add `round_mode` to `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` op to select rounding\n        algorithm.\n    *   Add `unicode_encode`, `unicode_decode`, `unicode_decode_with_offsets`,\n        `unicode_split`, `unicode_split_with_offset`, and `unicode_transcode`\n        ops. Amongst other things, this Op adds the ability to encode, decode,\n        and transcode a variety of input text encoding formats into the main\n        Unicode encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16-BE, UTF-32-BE)\n    *   Add \"unit\" attribute to the substr op, which allows obtaining the\n        substring of a string containing unicode characters.\n    *   Broadcasting support for Ragged Tensors.\n    *   `SpaceToDepth` supports uint8 data type.\n    *   Support multi-label quantile regression in estimator.\n    *   We now use \"div\" as the default partition_strategy in\n        `tf.nn.safe_embedding_lookup_sparse`, `tf.nn.sampled_softmax` and\n        `tf.nn.nce_loss`. hyperparameter are ignored.\n*   Performance\n    *   Improve performance of GPU cumsum/cumprod by up to 300x.\n    *   Added support for weight decay in most TPU embedding optimizers,\n        including AdamW and MomentumW.\n*   TensorFlow 2.0 Development\n    *   Add a command line tool to convert to TF2.0, tf_upgrade_v2\n    *   Merge `tf.spectral` into `tf.signal` for TensorFlow 2.0.\n    *   Change the default recurrent activation function for LSTM from\n        'hard_sigmoid' to 'sigmoid' in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is\n        'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend\n        between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we\n        change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the\n        default LSTM will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will\n        enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x\n        performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking\n        change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please\n        construct the layer with LSTM(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid') to\n        fallback to 1.x behavior.\n*   TensorFlow Lite\n    *   Move from `tensorflow/contrib/lite` to `tensorflow/lite`.\n    *   Add experimental Java API for injecting TensorFlow Lite delegates\n    *   Add support for strings in TensorFlow Lite Java API.\n*   `tf.contrib`:\n    *   Add Apache Ignite Filesystem plugin to support accessing Apache IGFS.\n    *   Dropout now takes `rate` argument, `keep_prob` is deprecated.\n    *   Estimator occurrences references `tf.contrib.estimator` were changed to\n        `tf.estimator`:\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.BaselineEstimator` with\n        `tf.estimator.BaselineEstimator`\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator` with\n        `tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator`\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNEstimator`\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.LinearEstimator` with\n        `tf.estimator.LinearEstimator`\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.InMemoryEvaluatorHook` and\n        tf.estimator.experimental.InMemoryEvaluatorHook`.\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook` with\n        `tf.estimator.experimental.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook`.\n    *   Expose `tf.distribute.Strategy as the new name for\n        tf.contrib.distribute.DistributionStrategy.\n    *   Migrate linear optimizer from contrib to core.\n    *   Move `tf.contrib.signal` to `tf.signal` (preserving aliases in\n        tf.contrib.signal).\n    *   Users of `tf.contrib.estimator.export_all_saved_models` and related\n        should switch to\n        `tf.estimator.Estimator.experimental_export_all_saved_models`.\n*   tf.data:\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.StatsOptions()`, to configure options to\n        collect statistics from `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline using\n        `StatsAggregator`. Add nested option, `experimental_stats` (which takes\n        a `tf.data.experimen tal.StatsOptions` object), to `tf.data.Options`.\n        Deprecates `tf.data.experimental.set_stats_agregator`.\n    *   Performance optimizations:\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions()`, to configure options\n        to enable `tf.data` performance optimizations. Add nested option,\n        `experimental_optimization` (which takes a\n        `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` object), to\n        `tf.data.Options`. Remove performance optimization options from\n        `tf.data.Options`, and add them under\n        `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` instead.\n    *   Enable `map_and_batch_fusion` and `noop_elimination` optimizations by\n        default. They can be disabled by configuring\n        `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` to set `map_and_batch =\n        False` or `noop_elimination = False` respectively. To disable all\n        default optimizations, set `apply_default_optimizations = False`.\n    *   Support parallel map in `map_and_filter_fusion`.\n    *   Disable static optimizations for input pipelines that use non-resource\n        `tf.Variable`s.\n    *   Add NUMA-aware MapAndBatch dataset.\n    *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()` in V1, removed it\n        from V2, and added tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator()`.\n    *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` in V1, removed\n        it from V2, and added `tf.compat.v1.data.make_initializable_iterator()`.\n    *   Enable nested dataset support in core `tf.data` transformations.\n    *   For `tf.data.Dataset` implementers: Added\n        `tf.data.Dataset._element_structured property` to replace\n        `Dataset.output_{types,shapes,classes}`.\n    *   Make `num_parallel_calls` of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` and\n        `tf.data.Dataset.map` work in Eager mode.\n*   Toolchains\n    *   Fixed OpenSSL compatibility by avoiding `EVP_MD_CTX_destroy`.\n    *   Added bounds checking to printing deprecation warnings.\n    *   Upgraded CUDA dependency to 10.0\n    *   To build with Android NDK r14b, add \"#include <linux/compiler.h>\" to\n        android-ndk-r14b/platforms/android-14/arch-*/usr/include/linux/futex.h\n    *   Removed `:android_tensorflow_lib_selective_registration*` targets, use\n        `:android_tensorflow_lib_lite*` targets instead.\n*   XLA\n    *   Move `RoundToEven` function to xla/client/lib/math.h.\n    *   A new environment variable `TF_XLA_DEBUG_OPTIONS_PASSTHROUGH` set to \"1\"\n        or \"true\" allows the debug options passed within an XRTCompile op to be\n        passed directly to the XLA compilation backend.

Catching a ValueError\n        exception thrown by `tf.contrib.get_signature_def_by_key` should be\n        replaced by catching a KeyError exception.\n*   `tf.contrib.data`\n    *   Deprecate, and replace by tf.data.experimental.\n*   Other:\n    *   Instead of jemalloc, revert back to using system malloc since it\n        simplifies build and has comparable performance.\n    *   Remove integer types from `tf.nn.softplus` and `tf.nn.softsign` OpDefs.\n        This is a bugfix; these ops were never meant to support integers.\n    *   Allow subslicing Tensors with a single dimension.\n    *   Add option to calculate string length in Unicode characters.\n    *   Add functionality to SubSlice a tensor.\n    *   Add searchsorted (ie lower/upper_bound) op.\n    *   Add model explainability to Boosted Trees.\n    *   Support negative positions for tf.substr.\n    *   There was previously a bug in the bijector_impl where the\n        _reduce_jacobian_det_over_event does not handle scalar ILDJ\n        implementations properly.\n    *   In tf eager execution, allow re-entering a GradientTape context.\n    *   Add tf_api_version flag. If --define=tf_api_version=2 flag is passed in,\n        then bazel will build TensorFlow API version 2.0. Note that TensorFlow\n        2.0 is under active development and has no guarantees at this point.\n    *   Add additional compression options to TfRecordWriter.\n    *   Performance improvements for regex full match operations.\n    *   Replace tf.GraphKeys.VARIABLES with `tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`.\n    *   Remove unused dynamic learning rate support.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n(David) Siu-Kei Muk, Ag Ramesh, Anton Dmitriev, Artem Sobolev, Avijit-Nervana,\nBairen Yi, Bruno Goncalves, By Shen, candy.dc, Cheng Chen, Clayne Robison,\ncoder3101, Dao Zhang, Elms, Fei Hu, feiquan, Geoffrey Irving, Guozhong Zhuang,\nhellcom, Hoeseong Kim, imsheridan, Jason Furmanek, Jason Zaman, Jenny Sahng,\njiefangxuanyan, Johannes Bannhofer, Jonathan Homer, Koan-Sin Tan, kouml, Loo\nRong Jie, Lukas Geiger, manipopopo, Ming Li, Moritz Kr\u00f6Ger, Naurril, Niranjan\nHasabnis, Pan Daoxin, Peng Yu, pengwa, rasmi, Roger Xin, Roland Fernandez, Sami\nKama, Samuel Matzek, Sangjung Woo, Sergei Lebedev, Sergii Khomenko, shaohua,\nShaohua Zhang, Shujian2015, Sunitha Kambhampati, tomguluson92, Vin\u00edCius Camargo,\nwangsiyu, weidankong, Wen-Heng (Jack) Chung, William D.

See\n        [README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/distribute)\n        for more details.\n*   Add C, C++, and Python functions for querying kernels.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n* Keras:\n  * The default values for tf.keras `RandomUniform`, `RandomNormal`, and `TruncatedNormal` initializers have been changed to match those in external Keras.\n  * Breaking change: `model.get_config()` on a Sequential model now returns a config dictionary (consistent with other Model instances) instead of a list of configs for the underlying layers.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   C++:\n    *   Changed the signature of SessionFactory::NewSession so that it can\n        return a meaningful error message on failure.\n*   tf.data:\n    *   Remove `num_parallel_parser_calls` argument from\n        `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset()`. [tf.data] Remove\n        `num_parallel_parser_calls` argument from\n        `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset()`.\n    *   `tf.data.Dataset.list_files()` raises an exception at initialization\n        time if the argument matches no files.\n    *   Renamed BigTable class to BigtableTable for clarity\n    *   Document use of the Cloud Bigtable API\n    *   Add `tf.contrib.data.reduce_dataset` which can be used to reduce a\n        dataset to a single element.\n    *   Generalization of `tf.contrib.data.sliding_window_batch`.\n*   INC:\n    *   Runtime improvements to triangular solve.\n*   `tf.contrib`:\n    *   Add an `implementation` argument to `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D`\n        and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D`. The new mode\n        (`implementation=2`) performs forward pass as a single dense matrix\n        multiplication, allowing dramatic speedups in certain scenarios (but\n        worse performance in others - see docstring). The option also allows to\n        use `padding=same`.\n    *   Add documentation clarifying the differences between tf.fill and\n        tf.constant.\n    *   Add experimental IndexedDatasets.\n    *   Add selective registration target using the lite proto runtime.\n    *   Add simple Tensor and DataType classes to TensorFlow Lite Java\n    *   Add support for bitcasting to/from uint32 and uint64.\n    *   Added a subclass of Estimator that can be created from a SavedModel\n        (SavedModelEstimator).\n    *   Adds leaf index modes as an argument.\n    *   Allow a different output shape from the input in\n        tf.contrib.image.transform.\n    *   Change the state_size order of the StackedRNNCell to be natural order.\n        To keep the existing behavior, user can add reverse_state_order=True\n        when constructing the StackedRNNCells.\n    *   Deprecate self.test_session() in favor of self.session() or\n        self.cached_session().\n    *   Directly import tensor.proto.h (the transitive import will be removed\n        from tensor.h soon).\n    *   Estimator.train() now supports tf.contrib.summary.\\* summaries out of\n        the box; each call to .train() will now create a separate tfevents file\n        rather than re-using a shared one.\n    *   Fix FTRL L2-shrinkage behavior: the gradient from the L2 shrinkage term\n        should not end up in the accumulator.\n    *   Fix toco compilation/execution on Windows.\n    *   GoogleZoneProvider class added to detect which Google Cloud Engine zone\n        tensorflow is running in.\n    *   It is now safe to call any of the C API's TF_Delete\\* functions on\n        nullptr.\n    *   Log some errors on Android to logcat.\n    *   Match FakeQuant numerics in TFLite to improve accuracy of TFLite\n        quantized inference models.\n    *   Optional bucket location check for the GCS Filesystem.\n    *   Performance enhancements for StringSplitOp & StringSplitV2Op.\n    *   Performance improvements for regex replace operations.\n    *   TFRecordWriter now raises an error if .write() fails.\n    *   TPU: More helpful error messages in TPUClusterResolvers.\n    *   The legacy_init_op argument to SavedModelBuilder methods for adding\n        MetaGraphs has been deprecated. Please use the equivalent main_op\n        argument instead. As part of this, we now explicitly check for a single\n        main_op or legacy_init_op at the time of SavedModel building, whereas\n        the check on main_op was previously only done at load time.\n    *   The protocol used for Estimator training is now configurable in\n        RunConfig.\n    *   Triangular solve performance improvements.\n    *   Unify RNN cell interface between TF and Keras. Add new\n        get_initial_state() to Keras and TF RNN cell, which will use to replace\n        the existing zero_state() method.\n    *   Update initialization of variables in Keras.\n    *   Updates to \"constrained_optimization\" in tensorflow/contrib.\n    *   boosted trees: adding pruning mode.\n    *   tf.train.Checkpoint does not delete old checkpoints by default.\n    *   tfdbg: Limit the total disk space occupied by dumped tensor data to 100\n        GBytes. Add environment variable `TFDBG_DISK_BYTES_LIMIT` to allow\n        adjustment of this upper limit.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAapeli, adoda, Ag Ramesh, Amogh Mannekote, Andrew Gibiansky, Andy Craze, Anirudh Koul, Aurelien Geron, Avijit, Avijit-Nervana, Ben, Benjamin H.

No new binaries will be built for Windows.\n\n\n# Release 1.10.0\n\n## Major Features And Improvements\n\n* The `tf.lite` runtime now supports `complex64`.\n* Initial [Google Cloud Bigtable integration](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.10/tensorflow/contrib/bigtable) for `tf.data`.\n* Improved local run behavior in `tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate` which does not reload checkpoints for evaluation.\n* `RunConfig` now sets device_filters to restrict how workers and PS can communicate. This can speed up training and ensure clean shutdowns in some situations. But if you have jobs that require communication between workers, you will have to set custom session_options in your `RunConfig`.\n* Moved Distributions and Bijectors from `tf.contrib.distributions` to [Tensorflow Probability (TFP)](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability). `tf.contrib.distributions` is now deprecated and will be removed by the end of 2018.\n* Adding new endpoints for existing tensorflow symbols. These endpoints are going to be the preferred endpoints going forward and may replace some of the existing endpoints in the future. See below for the complete list. New symbols have been added to the following modules: [`tf.debugging`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/debugging), [`tf.dtypes`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/dtypes), [`tf.image`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/image), [`tf.io`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/io), [`tf.linalg`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/linalg), [`tf.manip`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/manip), [`tf.math`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/math), [`tf.quantization`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/quantization), [`tf.strings`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/strings)\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n* Prebuilt binaries are now (as of TensorFlow 1.10) built against NCCL 2.2 and no longer include NCCL in the binary install. TensorFlow usage with multiple GPUs and NCCL requires upgrade to [NCCL 2.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl). See updated install guides: [TensorFlow GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) and [Build TensorFlow from source](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source).\n* Starting from TensorFlow 1.11, Windows builds will use Bazel. Therefore, we will drop official support for cmake.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n* `tf.data`:\n  * `tf.contrib.data.group_by_reducer()` is now available via the public API.\n  * `tf.contrib.data.choose_from_datasets()` is now available via the public API.\n  * Adding `drop_remainder` argument to `tf.data.Dataset.batch()` and `tf.data.Dataset.padded_batch()`, deprecating `tf.contrib.data.batch_and_drop_remainder()` and `tf.contrib.data.padded_batch_and_drop_remainder()`.\n* `tf.estimator`:\n  * `Estimator`s now use custom savers included in `EstimatorSpec` scaffolds for saving SavedModels during export.\n  * `EstimatorSpec` will now add a default prediction output for export if no `export_output` is provided, eliminating the need to explicitly include a `PredictOutput` object in the `model_fn` for simple use-cases.\n  * Support sparse_combiner in canned Linear Estimators.\n  * Added batch normalization to `DNNClassifier`, `DNNRegressor`, and `DNNEstimator`.\n  * Adding ranking support for boosted trees.\n  * Adding center bias option for boosted trees.\n* Add `synchronization` and `aggregation` args to get_variable(). These args will be used for distributed variables.\n* Add `synchronization` and `aggregation` args to the layer `add_weight()` API. These args will be used for distributed variables.\n* `tf.losses.*` do not add to the global collection when executing eagerly (to avoid leaking memory).\n* Support different summary and checkpoint directories in `tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession()`.\n* Added IndRNN, IndyGRU, and IndyLSTM cells to `tf.contrib.rnn`.\n* Add safe static factory functions for SparseTensor and convert all CHECKs to DCHECKs. Using the constructor directly is unsafe and deprecated.\n* Make the Bigtable client connection pool configurable & increase the default # of connections for performance.\n* Added derivative of `tf.random_gamma` with respect to the alpha parameter.\n* Added derivative of `tf.igamma(a, x)` and `tf.igammac(a, x)` with respect to a.\n* Modified Bessel functions of order zero and one.\n* Add FillTriangular Bijector to create triangular matrices.\n* Added support for Type III DCT, and `tf.spectral.idct(type=2|3)`.\n* Correctly handle CuDNN RNN weight loaded when nest in `TimeDistributed`.\n* Adding per-element weight support for `WALSComputePartialLhsAndRhsOp`.\n* ZerosLike and OnesLike ops treated as constants by Graph Transform Tool.\n* Gamma distribution and the derived distributions (Beta, Dirichlet, Student's t, inverse Gamma) now fully reparameterized.\n* Java: Experimental wrapper classes to make graph generation easier. Thanks @karllessard and @kbsriram\n* Build & link in secure gRPC components (switch from the insecure grpc dependency to secure grpc dependency).\n* Adding new endpoints for existing tensorflow symbols. These endpoints are going to be the preferred endpoints going forward and may replace some of the existing endpoints in the future. List of new endpoints:\n  * New endpoints in `tf.image` namespace: `tf.image.extract_image_patches`\n  * New endpoints in `tf.debugging` namespace: `tf.debugging.check_numerics`, `tf.debugging.is_finite`, `tf.debugging.is_inf`, `tf.debugging.is_nan`.\n  * New endpoints in `tf.dtypes` namespace: `tf.dtypes.as_string`.\n  * New endpoints in `tf.io` namespace: `tf.io.decode_base64`, `tf.io.decode_compressed`, `tf.io.decode_json_example`, `tf.io.decode_raw`, `tf.io.encode_base64`, `tf.io.matching_files`, `tf.io.parse_tensor`, `tf.io.read_file, `tf.io.write_file`.\n  * New endpoints in tf.linalg namespace: `tf.linalg.cross`, `tf.linalg.tensor_diag` (corresponds to `tf.diag`), `tf.linalg.tensor_diag_part` (corresponds to `tf.diag_part`).\n  * New endpoints in tf.manip namespace: `tf.manip.batch_to_space_nd`, `tf.manip.gather_nd`, `tf.manip.reshape`, `tf.manip.reverse`, `tf.manip.scatter_nd`, `tf.manip.space_to_batch_nd`, `tf.manip.tile`\n  * New endpoints in tf.math namespace: `tf.math.acos`, `tf.math.acosh`, `tf.math.add`, `tf.math.asin`, `tf.math.asinh`, `tf.math.atan`, `tf.math.atan2`, `tf.math.atanh`, `tf.math.betainc`, `tf.math.ceil`, `tf.math.cos`, `tf.math.cosh`, `tf.math.digamma`, `tf.math.equal`, `tf.math.erfc`, `tf.math.exp`, `tf.math.expm1`, `tf.math.floor`, `tf.math.greater`, `tf.math.greater_equal`, `tf.math.igamma`, `tf.math.igammac`, `tf.math.invert_permutation`, `tf.math.less`, `tf.math.less_equal`, `tf.math.lgamma`, `tf.math.log`, `tf.math.log1p`, `tf.math.logical_and`, `tf.math.logical_not`, `tf.math.logical_or`, `tf.math.maximum`, `tf.math.minimum`, `tf.math.not_equal`, `tf.math.polygamma`, `tf.math.reciprocal`, `tf.math.rint`, `tf.math.rsqrt`, `tf.math.segment_max`, `tf.math.segment_mean`, `tf.math.segment_min`, `tf.math.segment_prod`, `tf.math.segment_sum`, `tf.math.sin`, `tf.math.sinh`, `tf.math.softplus`, `tf.math.softsign`, `tf.math.squared_difference`, `tf.math.tan`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_max`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_min`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_prod`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum`, `tf.math.zeta`.\n  * New endpoints in `tf.quantization` namespace: `tf.quantization.dequantize`, `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_args`, `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_args_gradient`, `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars`,  `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_gradient`, `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_per_channel`,  `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_per_channel_gradient`.\n  * New endpoints in tf.strings namespace: `tf.strings.join` (corresponds to `tf.string_join`), `tf.strings.regex_replace`, `tf.strings.to_number` (corresponds to `tf.string_to_number`), `tf.strings.strip` (corresponds to `tf.string_strip`), `tf.strings.substr`, `tf.strings.to_hash_bucket` (corresponds to `tf.string_to_hash_bucket`), `tf.strings.to_hash_bucket_fast` (corresponds to `tf.string_to_hash_bucket_fast`), `tf.strings.to_hash_bucket_strong` (corresponds to `tf.string_to_hash_bucket_strong`).\n\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAg Ramesh, Alex Wiltschko, Alexander Pantyukhin, Amogh Mannekote, An Jiaoyang, Andrei Nigmatulin, Andrew Ginns, Bj\u00f8Rn Moholt, Brett Koonce, Chengzhi Chen, Chinmay Das, Christian Ertler, Christoph Boeddeker, Clayne Robison, Courtial Florian, ctiijima, Dan Douthit, Dan J, Dan Ringwalt, EFanZh, Emanuele Ballarin, eqy, Evgeniy Zheltonozhskiy, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fr\u00e9D\u00e9Ric Branchaud-Charron, G K, gracehoney, Guillaume Klein, Guozhong Zhuang, Hsien-Yang Li, hsm207, ImSheridan, Jayaram Bobba, Jiandong Ruan, Jie, Joel Shor, Jonas Rauber, Jongmin Baek, jsawruk, Karan Kaw, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kb Sriram, KinmanLam, leiiwang, Li, Yiqiang, Loo Rong Jie, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Mahmoud Aslan, ManHyuk, Martin Patz, Martin Zeitler, mktozk, Mohammad Ashraf Bhuiyan, mrTsjolder, Naman Bhalla, Nick Felt, Nicolas Lopez, Niranjan Hasabnis, Nishidha Panpaliya, Nitish, nrstott, Nutti, Parag Jain, PeterLee, Philipp Jund, Rach L, Rafal Wojdyla, Roland Zimmermann, Sergei Lebedev, SneakyFish5, Soila Kavulya, Sriram Veturi, Steven Schmatz, Taehoon Lee, Tang, Wenyi, Taras Sereda, Ted Chang, Tim Zaman, Tristan Rice, tucan, vchigrin, Vikram Tiwari, Vincent, WeberXie, William D.

[Try it](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/eager/python/examples/nmt_with_attention/nmt_with_attention.ipynb?linkId=53292082).\n* Adding support of core [feature columns](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/feature_columns) and [losses](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/losses) to [gradient boosted trees estimators](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/r1/boosted_trees).\n* The [python interface](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/lite)\n  for the [TFLite Optimizing Converter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/toco/README.md)\n  has been expanded, and the command line interface (AKA: `toco`, `tflite_convert`) is once again\n  included in the standard `pip` installation.\n* Improved data-loading and text processing with:\n    * [`tf.decode_compressed`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/decode_compressed)\n    * [`tf.string_strip`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/string_strip)\n    * [`tf.strings.regex_full_match`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/strings/regex_full_match)\n* Added experimental support for new pre-made Estimators:\n  * [`tf.contrib.estimator.BaselineEstimator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/BaselineEstimator)\n  * [`tf.contrib.estimator.RNNClassifier`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/RNNEstimator)\n  * [`tf.contrib.estimator.RNNEstimator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/RNNClassifier)\n* The [distributions.Bijector](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/distributions/bijectors/Bijector)\n  API supports broadcasting for Bijectors with new API changes.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n  * If you're opening empty variable scopes; replace `variable_scope('', ...)` by\n    `variable_scope(tf.get_variable_scope(), ...)`.\n  * Headers used for building custom ops have been moved from site-packages/external into site-packages/tensorflow/include/external.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   `tfe.Network` is deprecated. Please inherit from `tf.keras.Model`.\n*   Layered variable names have changed in the following conditions:\n    *   Using `tf.keras.layers` with custom variable scopes.\n    *   Using `tf.layers` in a subclassed `tf.keras.Model` class. See\n        [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/layers)\n        for more details\n*   `tf.data`:\n    *   `Dataset.from_generator()` now accepts an `args` list, in order to\n        create nested generators.\n    *   `Dataset.list_files()` now produces deterministic results when\n        `shuffle=False` or a `seed` is passed.\n    *   `tf.contrib.data.sample_from_datasets()` and\n        `tf.contrib.data.choose_from_datasets()` make it easier to sample or\n        deterministically choose elements from multiple datasets.\n    *   `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset()` now supports line breaks in quoted\n        strings, and two infrequently used arguments removed.\n    *   (C++) `DatasetBase::DebugString()` is now `const`.\n    *   (C++) `DatasetBase::MakeIterator()` has been renamed to\n        `DatasetBase::MakeIteratorInternal()`.\n    *   (C++) `IteratorBase::Initialize()` method was added to support raising\n        errors during iterator construction.\n*   Eager Execution:\n    *   Added the ability to pause recording operations for gradient computation\n        via `tf.GradientTape.stop_recording`.\n    *   Updated documentation, introductory notebooks.\n*   `tf.keras`:\n    *   Move Keras code out of _impl folder and remove API files.\n    *   `tf.keras.Model.save_weights` now saves in TensorFlow format by default.\n    *   Enable dataset iterators to be passed to `tf.keras.Model` training/eval\n        methods.\n*   TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg) CLI: fix an issue in which the TensorBoard\n    Debugger Plugin could not handle total source file size exceeding gRPC\n    message size limit (4 MB).\n*   `tf.contrib`:\n    *   `tf.contrib.framework.zero_initializer` supports ResourceVariable.\n    *   Adding \"constrained_optimization\" to tensorflow/contrib.\n*   Other:\n    *   Add GCS Configuration Ops.\n    *   Changing signature of `MakeIterator` to enable propagating error status.\n    *   KL divergence for two Dirichlet distributions.\n    *   More consistent GcsFileSystem behavior for certain reads past EOF.\n    *   Update benchmark for tf.scan to match ranges across eager and graph\n        modes.\n    *   Fixed bug in `tf.reduce_prod gradient` for complex dtypes.\n    *   Allow the use of '.' in variables (e.g. \"hparams.parse('a.b=1.0')\"),\n        which would previously raise an error. This will correspond to an\n        attribute name with an embedded '.' symbol (e.g. 'a.b'), which can only\n        be accessed indirectly (e.g. through getattr and setattr). To set this\n        up the user will first need to explicitly add the variable to the hparam\n        object (e.g. \"hparams.add_hparam(name='a.b', value=0.0)\").\n    *   Benchmark for tf.scan in graph and eager modes.\n    *   Added complex128 support to FFT, FFT2D, FFT3D, IFFT, IFFT2D, and IFFT3D.\n    *   Making ids unique in `nn.embedding_lookup_sparse`. This helps to reduce\n        RPC calls for looking up the embeddings when there are repeated ids in\n        the batch.\n    *   Support indicator column in boosted trees.\n    *   Prevent `tf.gradients()` from backpropagating through integer tensors.\n    *   LinearOperator[1D,2D,3D]Circulant added to `tensorflow.linalg`.\n    *   Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInput, Conv3DBackpropFilter now supports\n        arbitrary.\n    *   Added `tf.train.Checkpoint` for reading/writing object-based\n        checkpoints.\n    *   Added LinearOperatorKronecker, a dense-free implementation of the\n        Kronecker Product.\n    *   Allow LinearOperator to broadcast.\n    *   SavedModelBuilder will now deduplicate asset names that point to files\n        with the same basename and the same contents.

Both `Dataset.__iter__()` and `Dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()` can now be used to create iterators when eager execution is enabled.\n  * Automatic device placement has been enabled (i.e., use a GPU if available automatically, without requiring an explicit `with tf.device(\u201c/gpu:0\u201d)`) (Fixes #14133)\n  * `tf.GradientTape` has moved out of contrib.\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * Added the fashion mnist dataset.\n  * New data preprocessing functions: `image/random_brightness`, `sequence/TimeseriesGenerator`, and `text/hashing_trick`.\n* Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA):\n  * Select and scatter in reference util and evaluator now use lexicographical order to break ties.\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg) CLI:\n  * During tensor-filter operations, allow exclusion of nodes by regular expressions.\n  * Fix spurious background colors in some text terminals.\n* `tf.contrib`:\n  * Add meta-distribution BatchReshape which reshapes batch dimensions.\n  * `tf.contrib.layers.recompute_grad` works for explicit gradient checkpointing on TPU.\n  * Add `tf.contrib.framework.argsort`.\n  * Allow `DNNBoostedTreeCombinedEstimator` to work with core versions of feature columns and losses.\n  * Add non-linear image warping ops: `tf.contrib.image.sparse_image_warp`, `tf.contrib.image.dense_image_warp`, and `tf.contrib.image.interpolate_spline`.\n  * Fix bug in `tf.contrib.opt.MultitaskOptimizerWrapper` where types of tensors were mismatched.\n* Other:\n  * Low-level graph construction now calls the TensorFlow C API. This change should be invisible to most users, but can be disabled by setting the environment variable `TF_C_API_GRAPH_CONSTRUCTION=0` in this release. Future releases will remove the ability to disable this change. Please [file a bug](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/new) if you find yourself using this escape hatch.\n  * Add description of shapes and a pointer to tutorial notebook in `tf.distributions.Distribution`.\n  * Update scatter operations:\n    * Add `tf.scatter_min` and `tf.scatter_max`\n    * Extend scatter operations to work with a scalar update parameter.\n  * Move cuDNN RNN ops to core for use in TensorFlow codebase only.\n  * Add `float64` support for `Conv2d`, `Conv2dBackpropInput`, and `Conv2dBackpropFilter`.\n  * Add `float64` support for `AvgPool`/`AvgPoolGrad`.\n  * Make graph name scope thread local so that they work correctly in multi-threaded environments.\n  * Update nsync synchronization library to avoid slow primitives on Linux.\n  * Removed need to put nsync/public on C include path when building custom ops.\n  * Add `tf.image.psnr`, `tf.image.ssim`, `tf.image.ssim_multiscale`, `tf.image.image_gradients`, `tf.image.sobel_edges`.\n  * Add links to https://js.tensorflow.org.\n  * Fix non-uniformity of orthogonal matrices.\n  * Fix bug where multi-image Estimator eval summaries were not displayed correctly.\n\n<a name=\"rpc-issue\"><sup>1</sup></a> The cancellation logic of the RPC op contains a concurrency error.

See\n    [Debugging TensorFlow Programs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/debugger)\n    for more details.\n  * Usability improvement: The frequently used tensor filter `has_inf_or_nan` is\n    now added to `Session` wrappers and hooks by default. So there is no need\n    for clients to call `.add_tensor_filter(tf_debug.has_inf_or_nan)` anymore.\n* SinhArcsinh (scalar) distribution added to `contrib.distributions`.\n* Make `GANEstimator` opensource.\n* `Estimator.export_savedmodel()` now includes all valid serving signatures\n  that can be constructed from the Serving Input Receiver and all available\n  ExportOutputs. For instance, a classifier may provide regression- and\n  prediction-flavored outputs, in addition to the classification-flavored one.\n  Building signatures from these allows TF Serving to honor requests using the\n  different APIs (Classify, Regress, and Predict). Furthermore,\n  `serving_input_receiver_fn()` may now specify alternative subsets of nodes\n  that may act as inputs. This allows, for instance, producing a prediction\n  signature for a classifier that accepts raw `Tensors` instead of a serialized\n  `tf.Example`.\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.hmc`.\n* Add `tf.contrib.distributions.MixtureSameFamily`.\n* Make `Dataset.shuffle()` always reshuffles after each iteration by default.\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.metropolis_hastings`.\n* Add `log_rate` parameter to `tf.contrib.distributions.Poisson`.\n* Extend `tf.contrib.distributions.bijector` API to handle some non-injective\n  transforms.\n* Java:\n  * Generics (e.g., `Tensor<Integer>`) for improved type-safety\n    (courtesy @andrewcmyers).\n  * Support for multi-dimensional string tensors.\n  * Support loading of custom operations (e.g. many in `tf.contrib`) on Linux\n    and OS X\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with CUDA 8 and cuDNN 6.\n  We anticipate releasing TensorFlow 1.5 with CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* `tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper` is now more careful about dropping out LSTM\n  states.  Specifically, it no longer ever drops the `c` (memory) state of an\n  `LSTMStateTuple`.  The new behavior leads to proper dropout behavior\n  for LSTMs and stacked LSTMs.  This bug fix follows recommendations from\n  published literature, but is a behavioral change.  State dropout behavior\n  may be customized via the new `dropout_state_filter_visitor` argument.\n* Removed `tf.contrib.training.python_input`.  The same behavior, in a more\n  flexible and reproducible package, is available via the new\n  `tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_generator` method!\n* Fix `tf.contrib.distributions.Affine` incorrectly computing log-det-jacobian.\n* Fix `tf.random_gamma` incorrectly handling non-batch, scalar draws.\n* Resolved a race condition in TensorForest TreePredictionsV4Op.\n* Google Cloud Storage file system, Amazon S3 file system, and Hadoop file\n  system support are now default build options.\n* Custom op libraries must link against libtensorflow_framework.so\n  (installed at `tf.sysconfig.get_lib()`).\n* Change `RunConfig` default behavior to not set a random seed, making random\n  behavior independently random on distributed workers. We expect this to\n  generally improve training performance. Models that do rely on determinism\n  should set a random seed explicitly.\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n* The signature of the `tf.contrib.data.rejection_resample()` function has been\n  changed. It now returns a function that can be used as an argument to\n  `Dataset.apply()`.\n* Remove `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.from_dataset()` method. Use\n  `Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` instead.\n* Remove seldom used and unnecessary `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.dispose_op()`.\n* Reorder some TF-GAN loss functions in a non-backwards compatible way.\n\n## Known Issues\n* In Python 3, `Dataset.from_generator()` does not support Unicode strings.\n  You must convert any strings to bytes objects before yielding them from\n  the generator.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n4d55397500, Abdullah Alrasheed, abenmao, Adam Salvail, Aditya Dhulipala, Ag Ramesh,\nAkimasa Kimura, Alan Du, Alan Yee, Alexander, Amit Kushwaha, Amy, Andrei Costinescu,\nAndrei Nigmatulin, Andrew Erlichson, Andrew Myers, Andrew Stepanov, Androbin, AngryPowman,\nAnish Shah, Anton Daitche, Artsiom Chapialiou, asdf2014, Aseem Raj Baranwal, Ash Hall,\nBart Kiers, Batchu Venkat Vishal, ben, Ben Barsdell, Bill Piel, Carl Thom\u00e9, Catalin Voss,\nChangming Sun, Chengzhi Chen, Chi Zeng, Chris Antaki, Chris Donahue, Chris Oelmueller,\nChris Tava, Clayne Robison, Codrut, Courtial Florian, Dalmo Cirne, Dan J, Darren Garvey,\nDavid Kristoffersson, David Norman, David R\u00f6Thlisberger, DavidNorman, Dhruv, DimanNe,\nDorokhov, Duncan Mac-Vicar P, EdwardDixon, EMCP, error.d, FAIJUL, Fan Xia,\nFrancois Xavier, Fred Reiss, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang,\nGuenther Schmuelling, Guo Yejun (\u90ed\u53f6\u519b), Hans Gaiser, HectorSVC, Hyungsuk Yoon,\nJames Pruegsanusak, Jay Young, Jean Wanka, Jeff Carpenter, Jeremy Rutman, Jeroen B\u00e9Dorf,\nJett Jones, Jimmy Jia, jinghuangintel, jinze1994, JKurland, Joel Hestness, joetoth,\nJohn B Nelson, John Impallomeni, John Lawson, Jonas, Jonathan Dekhtiar, joshkyh, Jun Luan,\nJun Mei, Kai Sasaki, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kb Sriram, Kenichi Ueno, Kevin Slagle,\nKongsea, Lakshay Garg, lhlmgr, Lin Min, liu.guangcong, Loki Der Quaeler, Louie Helm,\nlucasmoura, Luke Iwanski, Lyndon White, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Puyat, Mark Aaron Shirley,\nMichele Colombo, MtDersvan, Namrata-Ibm, Nathan Luehr, Naurril, Nayana Thorat, Nicolas Lopez,\nNiranjan Hasabnis, Nolan Liu, Nouce, Oliver Hennigh, osdamv, Patrik Erdes,\nPatryk Chrabaszcz, Pavel Christof, Penghao Cen, postBG, Qingqing Cao, Qingying Chen, qjivy,\nRaphael, Rasmi, raymondxyang, Renze Yu, resec, Roffel, Ruben Vereecken, Ryohei Kuroki,\nsandipmgiri, Santiago Castro, Scott Kirkland, Sean Vig, Sebastian Raschka, Sebastian Weiss,\nSergey Kolesnikov, Sergii Khomenko, Shahid, Shivam Kotwalia, Stuart Berg, Sumit Gouthaman,\nsuperzerg, Sven Mayer, tetris, Ti Zhou, Tiago Freitas Pereira, Tian Jin, Tomoaki Oiki,\nVaibhav Sood, vfdev, Vivek Rane, Vladimir Moskva, wangqr, Weber Xie, Will Frey,\nYan Facai (\u989c\u53d1\u624d), yanivbl6, Yaroslav Bulatov, Yixing Lao, Yong Tang, youkaichao,\nYuan (Terry) Tang, Yue Zhang, Yuxin Wu, Ziming Dong, ZxYuan, \u9ec4\u749e\n\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.\n\n# Release 1.3.0\n\nSee also [TensorBoard 0.1.4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/releases/tag/0.1.4) release notes.\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n* Added canned estimators to Tensorflow library. List of added estimators:\n  * `DNNClassifier`\n  * `DNNRegressor`\n  * `LinearClassifier`\n  * `LinearRegressor`\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedClassifier`\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedRegressor`.\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with cuDNN 6. We anticipate releasing TensorFlow 1.4 with cuDNN 7.\n* `import tensorflow` now goes much faster.\n* Adds a file cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable max staleness for file contents. This permits caching of file contents across close/open boundaries.\n* Added an axis parameter to `tf.gather`.\n* Added a `constant_values` keyword argument to `tf.pad`.\n* Adds `Dataset.interleave` transformation.\n* Add `ConcatenateDataset` to concatenate two datasets.\n* Added Mobilenet support to TensorFlow for Poets training script.\n* Adds a block cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable block size and count.\n* SinhArcSinh bijector added.\n* Added `Dataset.list_files` API.\n* Introduces new operations and Python bindings for the Cloud TPU.\n* Adding TensorFlow-iOS CocoaPod for symmetry with tensorflow-android.\n* Introduces base implementations of ClusterResolvers.\n* Unify memory representations of TensorShape and PartialTensorShape. As a consequence, tensors now have a maximum of 254 dimensions, not 255.\n* Changed references to LIBXSMM to use version 1.8.1.\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\n  * Display summaries of numeric tensor values with the `-s` flag to command `print_tensor` or `pt`.\n  * Display feed values with the `print_feed` or `pf` command and clickable links in the curses UI.\n  * Runtime profiler at the op level and the Python source line level with the `run -p` command.\n* Initial release of the statistical distribution library `tf.distributions`.\n* GPU kernels and speed improvements for unary `tf.where` and `tf.nn.top_k`.\n* Monotonic Attention wrappers added to `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\n* Added `tf.contrib.signal`, a library for signal processing primitives.\n* Added `tf.contrib.resampler`, containing CPU and GPU ops for differentiable resampling of images.\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n* `tf.RewriterConfig` was removed from the Python API after being available in 1.2 release candidates (it was never in an actual release). Graph rewriting is still available, just not as `tf.RewriterConfig`. Instead add an explicit import.\n* Breaking change to `tf.contrib.data.Dataset` APIs that expect a nested structure. Lists are now converted to `tf.Tensor` implicitly. You may need to change uses of lists to tuples in existing code. In addition, dicts are now supported as a nested structure.\n\n## Changes to contrib APIs\n* Adds tf.contrib.nn.rank_sampled_softmax_loss, a sampled-softmax variant that can improve rank loss.\n* `tf.contrib.metrics`.{streaming_covariance,streaming_pearson_correlation} modified to return nan when they have seen less or equal to 1 unit of weight.\n* Adds time series models to contrib. See contrib/timeseries/README.md for details.\n* Adds FULLY_CONNECTED Op to tensorflow/lite/schema.fbs\n\n## Known Issues\n* Tensorflow_gpu compilation fails with Bazel 0.5.3.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* Fixes `strides` and `begin` dtype mismatch when slicing using int64 Tensor index in python.\n* Improved convolution padding documentation.\n* Add a tag constant, gpu, to present graph with GPU support.\n* `saved_model.utils` now support SparseTensors transparently.\n* A more efficient implementation of non-max suppression.\n* Add support for the shrinkage-type L2 to FtrlOptimizer in addition to the online L2 it already supports.\n* Fix negative variance in moments calculation.\n* Expand UniqueOp Benchmark Tests to cover more collision cases.\n* Improves stability of GCS filesystem on Mac.\n* Add time estimation to HloCostAnalysis.\n* Fixed the bug in Estimator that params in constructor was not a deepcopy of the user provided one. This bugs inadvertently enabled user to mutate the params after the creation of Estimator, leading to potentially undefined behavior.\n* Added None check for save_path in `saver.restore`.\n* Register devices under their legacy names in device_mgr to ease the transition to clusterspec-propagated configurations.\n* VectorExponential added to distributions.\n* Add a bitwise module with bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, and invert functions.\n* Add fixed-grid ODE integration routines.\n* Allow passing bounds to ScipyOptimizerInterface.\n* Correctness fixes for fft_length parameter to `tf.spectral.rfft` & `tf.spectral.irfft`.\n* Exported model signatures using the 'predict' method will no longer have their input and output keys silently ignored and rewritten to 'inputs' and 'outputs'. If a model was exported with different names before 1.2, and is now served with tensorflow/serving, it will accept requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs'. Starting at 1.2, such a model will accept the keys specified during export. Therefore, inference requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs' may start to fail. To fix this, either update any inference clients to send requests with the actual input and output keys used by the trainer code, or conversely, update the trainer code to name the input and output Tensors 'inputs' and 'outputs', respectively. Signatures using the 'classify' and 'regress' methods are not affected by this change; they will continue to standardize their input and output keys as before.\n* Add in-memory caching to the Dataset API.\n* Set default end_of_sequence variable in datasets iterators to false.\n* [Performance] Increase performance of `tf.layers.conv2d` when setting use_bias=True by 2x by using nn.bias_add.\n* Update iOS examples to use CocoaPods, and moved to tensorflow/examples/ios.\n* Adds a family= attribute in `tf.summary` ops to allow controlling the tab name used in Tensorboard for organizing summaries.\n* When GPU is configured, do not require --config=cuda, instead, automatically build for GPU if this is requested in the configure script.\n* Fix incorrect sampling of small probabilities in CPU/GPU multinomial.\n* Add a list_devices() API on sessions to list devices within a cluster. Additionally, this change augment the ListDevices master API to support specifying a session.\n* Allow uses of over-parameterized separable convolution.\n* TensorForest multi-regression bug fix.\n* Framework now supports armv7, cocoapods.org now displays correct page.\n* Script to create iOS framework for CocoaPods.\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier integration into apps. See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/android/inference_interface/README.md for more details.\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from functioning with multi-GPU setups.\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from working with `tf.Session.make_callable`.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n4F2E4A2E, Adriano Carmezim, Adri\u00e0 Arrufat, Alan Yee, Alex Lattas, Alex Rothberg,\nAlexandr Baranezky, Ali Siddiqui, Andreas Solleder, Andrei Costinescu, Andrew Hundt,\nAndrobin, Andy Kernahan, Anish Shah, Anthony Platanios, Arvinds-Ds, b1rd, Baptiste\nArnaud, Ben Mabey, Benedikt Linse, Beomsu Kim, Bo Wang, Boyuan Deng, Brett Koonce,\nBruno Rosa, Carl Thom\u00e9, Changming Sun, Chase Roberts, Chirag Bhatia, Chris Antaki,\nChris Hoyean Song, Chris Tava, Christos Nikolaou, Croath Liu, cxx, Czxck001, Daniel\nYlitalo, Danny Goodman, Darren Garvey, David Brailovsky, David Norman, DavidNorman,\ndavidpham87, ddurham2, Dhruv, DimanNe, Drew Hintz, Dustin Tran, Earthson Lu, ethiraj,\nFabian Winnen, Fei Sun, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang, Gautam,\nGuenther Schmuelling, Gyu-Ho Lee, Hauke Brammer, horance, Humanity123, J Alammar,\nJayeol Chun, Jeroen B\u00e9Dorf, Jianfei Wang, jiefangxuanyan, Jing Jun Yin, Joan Puigcerver,\nJoel Hestness, Johannes Mayer, John Lawson, Johnson145, Jon Malmaud, Jonathan Alvarez-Gutierrez,\nJuang, Yi-Lin, Julian Viereck, Kaarthik Sivashanmugam, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kevin\nCarbone, Kevin Van Der Burgt, Kongsea, ksellesk, lanhin, Lef Ioannidis, Liangliang He,\nLouis Tiao, Luke Iwanski, L\u00e1Szl\u00f3 Csomor, magixsno, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Hlopko, Mark\nNeumann, Maxwell Paul Brickner, mdfaijul, Micha\u00ebL Defferrard, Micha\u0142 Jastrz\u0119Bski, Michele\nColombo, Mike Brodie, Mosnoi Ion, mouradmourafiq, myPrecious, Nayana Thorat,\nNeeraj Kashyap, Nelson Liu, Niranjan Hasabnis, Olivier Moindrot, orome, Pankaj Gupta, Paul\nVan Eck, peeyush18, Peng Yu, Pierre, preciousdp11, qjivy, Raingo, raoqiyu, ribx, Richard S.\nImaoka, Rishabh Patel, Robert Walecki, Rockford Wei, Ryan Kung, Sahil Dua, Sandip Giri, Sayed\nHadi Hashemi, sgt101, Shitian Ni, Shuolongbj, Siim P\u00f5Der, Simon Perkins, sj6077, SOLARIS,\nSpotlight0xff, Steffen Eberbach, Stephen Fox, superryanguo, Sven Mayer, Tapan Prakash,\nTiago Morais Morgado, Till Hoffmann, Tj Rana, Vadim Markovtsev, vhasanov, Wei Wu,\nwindead, Yan (Asta) Li, Yan Chen, Yann Henon, Yi Wang, Yong Tang, yorkie, Yuan (Terry)\nTang, Yuxin Wu, zhengjiajin, zhongzyd, \u9ec4\u749e\n\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.\n\n# Release 1.2.1\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* Updating markdown version required to >= 2.6.8.\n* Support tensors as dropout rates again, by removing the min(max(..))\n\n# Release 1.2.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n* Python 3.6 support on Windows.\n* Added `tf.layers.conv3d_transpose` layer for spatio temporal deconvolution.\n* Added `tf.Session.make_callable()`, which provides a lower overhead means of running a similar step multiple times.\n* Added libverbs-based RDMA support to contrib (courtesy @junshi15 from Yahoo).\n* Bring `tf.feature_column.*` into the API. Non-deprecated functionality from `tf.contrib.layers.*` is moved to `tf.feature_column.*` with cosmetic changes.\n* `RNNCell` objects now subclass `tf.layers.Layer`.  The strictness described\n  in the TensorFlow 1.1 release is gone:  The first time an RNNCell is used,\n  it caches its scope.  All future uses of the RNNCell will reuse variables from\n  that same scope.  This is a breaking change from the behavior of RNNCells\n  in TensorFlow versions <= 1.0.1.  TensorFlow 1.1 had checks in place to\n  ensure old code works correctly with the new semantics; this version\n  allows more flexible uses of RNNCell but can lead to subtle errors if\n  using code meant for TensorFlow <= 1.0.1.  For example, writing:\n  `MultiRNNCell([lstm] * 5)` will now build a 5-layer LSTM stack where each\n  layer shares the **same** parameters.  To get 5 layers each with their own\n  parameters, write: `MultiRNNCell([LSTMCell(...) for _ in range(5)])`.\n  If at all unsure, first test your code with TF 1.1; ensure it raises no\n  errors, and then upgrade to TF 1.2.\n* RNNCells' variable names have been renamed for consistency with Keras layers.\n  Specifically, the previous variable names \"weights\" and \"biases\" have\n  been changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the tool\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\n* Many of the RNN functions and classes that were in the `tf.nn` namespace\n  before the 1.0 release and which were moved to `tf.contrib.rnn` have now\n  been moved back to the core namespace.  This includes\n  `RNNCell`, `LSTMCell`, `GRUCell`, and a number of other cells.  These\n  now reside in `tf.nn.rnn_cell` (with aliases in `tf.contrib.rnn` for backwards\n  compatibility).  The original `tf.nn.rnn` function is now `tf.nn.static_rnn`,\n  and the bidirectional static and state saving static rnn functions are also\n  now back in the `tf.nn` namespace.\n\n  Notable exceptions are the `EmbeddingWrapper`, `InputProjectionWrapper` and\n  `OutputProjectionWrapper`,  which will slowly be moved to deprecation\n  in `tf.contrib.rnn`.  These are inefficient wrappers that should often\n  be replaced by calling `embedding_lookup` or `layers.dense` as pre- or post-\n  processing of the rnn.  For RNN decoding, this functionality has been replaced\n  with an alternative API in `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\n* Intel MKL Integration (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/tensorflow-optimizations-on-modern-intel-architecture). Intel developed a number of\n  optimized deep learning primitives: In addition to matrix multiplication and\n  convolution, these building blocks include:\n  Direct batched convolution\n  Pooling: maximum, minimum, average\n  Normalization: LRN, batch normalization\n  Activation: rectified linear unit (ReLU)\n  Data manipulation: multi-dimensional transposition (conversion), split,\n  concat, sum and scale.\n* TensorForest Estimator now supports SavedModel export for serving.\n* Support client-provided ClusterSpec's and propagate them to all workers to enable the creation of dynamic TensorFlow clusters.\n* TensorFlow C library now available for Windows.\n* We released a new open-source version of TensorBoard.\n* [`SavedModel CLI`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/guide/saved_model_cli) tool available to inspect and execute MetaGraph in SavedModel\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier\n  integration into apps. See\n  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/android/inference_interface/README.md\n  for more details.\n\n## Deprecations\n\n* TensorFlow 1.2 may be the last time we build with cuDNN 5.1. Starting with\n  TensorFlow 1.3, we will try to build all our prebuilt binaries with cuDNN 6.0.\n  While we will try to keep our source code compatible with cuDNN 5.1, it will\n  be best effort.\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n* `org.tensorflow.contrib.android.TensorFlowInferenceInterface` now throws exceptions where possible and has simplified method signatures.\n\n## Changes to contrib APIs\n* Added `tf.contrib.util.create_example`.\n* Added bilinear interpolation to `tf.contrib.image`.\n* Add `tf.contrib.stateless` for random ops with custom seed control.\n* MultivariateNormalFullCovariance added to contrib/distributions/\n* tensorflow/contrib/rnn undergoes RNN cell variable renaming for\n  consistency with Keras layers. Specifically, the previous variable names\n  \"weights\" and \"biases\" are changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\n* Added `tf.contrib.kernel_methods` module with Ops and estimators for primal\n  (explicit) kernel methods in TensorFlow.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* In python, `Operation.get_attr` on type attributes returns the Python DType\n  version of the type to match expected get_attr documentation rather than the\n  protobuf enum.\n* tensorflow/contrib/rnn undergoes RNN cell variable renaming for\n  consistency with Keras layers. Specifically, the previous variable names\n  \"weights\" and \"biases\" are changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\n* Changed MIN_SDK version to 8.0 when building iOS libraries.\n* Fixed LIBXSMM integration.\n* Make decode_jpeg/decode_png/decode_gif handle all formats, since users frequently try to decode an image as the wrong type.\n* Improve implicit broadcasting lowering.\n* Improving stability of GCS/BigQuery clients by a faster retrying of stale transmissions.\n* Remove OpKernelConstruction::op_def() as part of minimizing proto dependencies.\n* VectorLaplaceDiag distribution added.\n* Android demo no longer requires libtensorflow_demo.so to run (libtensorflow_inference.so still required)\n* Added `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file`.\n* Introduce ops for batching/unbatching tensors across Session::Run() calls.\n* Add tf.log_sigmoid(x) = tf.log(tf.sigmoid(x)) = -tf.nn.softplus(-x).\n* Changed hooks lists to immutable tuples, and now allow any iterable for the associated arguments.\n* Introduce TFDecorator.\n* Added an Mfcc op for speech feature generation.\n* Improved DirectSession::Run() overhead and error checking. Feeding a value of the wrong type will now synchronously raise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error instead of asynchronously raising an INTERNAL error. Code that depends on the (undefined) behavior when feeding a tensor of the wrong type may need to be updated.\n* Added unreduced NONE, and reduced MEAN options for losses. Removed \"WEIGHTED_\" prefix from other Reduction constants.\n* assertAllClose now handles dicts.\n* Added Gmock matcher for HloInstructions.\n* Add var name to errors on variable restore.\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\n* Added `reduction` arg to losses.\n* `tf.placeholder` can represent scalar shapes and partially known.\n* Remove estimator_spec(mode) argument.\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\n* TensorBoard disables all runs by default if there are more than 40 runs.\n* Removed old doc generator code.\n* GCS file system integration now supports domain buckets, e.g gs://bucket.domain.com/path.\n* Add `tf.summary.text` for outputting text to TensorBoard.\n* The \"run\" command of tfdbg's command-line interface now supports filtering of tensors by node name, op type and tensor dtype.\n* `tf.string_to_number` now supports int64 and float64 outputs.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n4F2E4A2E, Aaron Schumacher, Abhi Agg, admcrae, Adriano Carmezim, Adri\u00e0 Arrufat,\nagramesh1, Akimitsu Seo, Alan Mosca, Alex Egg, Alex Rothberg, Alexander Heinecke,\nAlexander Matyasko, Alexandr Baranezky, Alexandre Caulier, Ali Siddiqui, Anand Venkat,\nAndrew Hundt, Androbin, Anmol Sharma, Arie, Arno Leist, Arron Cao, Aur\u00e9Lien Geron, Bairen Yi,\nBeomsu Kim, Carl Thom\u00e9, cfperez, Changming Sun, Corey Wharton, critiqjo, Dalei Li, Daniel\nRasmussen, Daniel Trebbien, Dar\u00edO Here\u00f1\u00fa, David Eng, David Norman, David Y.

Moved existing FFT ops to `tf.spectral` while\n  keeping an alias in the old location (`tf.*`).\n* Added 1D, 2D and 3D Fourier transform ops for real signals to `tf.spectral`.\n* Added a `tf.bincount` function.\n* Added Keras 2 API to contrib.\n* Added a new lightweight queue-like object - `RecordInput`.\n* Added `tf.contrib.image.compose_transforms` function.\n* Bring `tf.estimator.*` into the API. Non-deprecated functionality from `tf.contrib.learn.Estimator` is moved to `tf.estimator.Estimator` with cosmetic changes.\n* Docker images: TF images on gcr.io and Docker Hub are upgraded to ubuntu:16.04.\n* Added the following features to TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\n  * Ability to inspect Python source file against TF ops and tensors (command `print_source` / `ps`)\n  * New navigation bar in Curses-based UI\n  * NodeStepper (command `invoke_stepper`) now uses intermediate tensor dumps. It also uses `TensorHandles` as direct feeds during successive `cont` calls for improved performance and reduced memory consumption.\n* Initial release of installation guides for Java, C, and Go.\n* Added Text Dashboard to TensorBoard.\n\n## Deprecations\n\n* TensorFlow 1.1.0 will be the last time we release a binary with Mac GPU support. Going forward, we will stop testing on Mac GPU systems. We continue to welcome patches that maintain Mac GPU support, and we will try to keep the Mac GPU build working.\n\n## Changes to contrib APIs\n* The behavior of RNNCells is now stricter due to the transition towards making RNNCells act more like Keras layers.\n  * If an RNNCell is used twice in two different variable scopes, an error is raised describing how to avoid this behavior.\n  * If an RNNCell is used in a variable scope with existing conflicting variables, an error is raised showing that the RNNCell must be constructed with argument `reuse=True`.\n* Deprecated contrib/distributions `pmf`, `pdf`, `log_pmf`, `log_pdf`.\n* Moved `bayesflow.special_math` to distributions.\n* `tf.contrib.tensor_forest.python.tensor_forest.RandomForestDeviceAssigner` removed.\n* Changed some MVN classes and parameters:\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalFull` replaced by `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalTriL`.\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalCholesky` replaced by `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalTriL`\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiagWithSoftplusStDev` replaced\n    by `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiagWithSoftplusScale`\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiag` arguments changed from `mu`, `diag_stddev` to `log`, `scale_diag`.\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiagPlusVDVT` removed.\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiagPlusLowRank` added.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* Java: Support for loading models exported using the SavedModel API (courtesy @EronWright).\n* Go: Added support for incremental graph execution.\n* Fix a bug in the WALS solver when single-threaded.\n* Added support for integer sparse feature values in `tf.contrib.layers.sparse_column_with_keys`.\n* Fixed `tf.set_random_seed(0)` to be deterministic for all ops.\n* Stability improvements for the GCS file system support.\n* Improved TensorForest performance.\n* Added support for multiple filename globs in `tf.matching_files`.\n* `LogMessage` now includes a timestamp as beginning of a message.\n* Added MultiBox person detector example standalone binary.\n* Android demo: Makefile build functionality added to build.gradle to fully support building TensorFlow demo in Android on Windows.\n* Android demo: read MultiBox priors from txt file rather than protobuf.\n* Added colocation constraints to `StagingArea`.\n* `sparse_matmul_op` reenabled for Android builds.\n* Restrict weights rank to be the same as the broadcast target, to avoid ambiguity on broadcast rules.\n* Upgraded libxsmm to 1.7.1 and applied other changes for performance and memory usage.\n* Fixed bfloat16 integration of LIBXSMM sparse mat-mul.\n* Improved performance and reduce memory usage by allowing ops to forward input buffers to output buffers and perform computations in-place.\n* Improved the performance of CPU assignment for strings.\n* Speed up matrix * vector multiplication and matrix * matrix with unknown shapes.\n* C API: Graph imports now support input remapping, control dependencies, and returning imported nodes (see `TF_GraphImportGraphDefWithReturnOutputs()`)\n* Multiple C++ API updates.\n* Multiple TensorBoard updates including:\n  * Users can now view image summaries at various sampled steps (instead of just the last step).\n  * Bugs involving switching runs as well as the image dashboard are fixed.\n  * Removed data download links from TensorBoard.\n  * TensorBoard uses a relative data directory, for easier embedding.\n  * TensorBoard automatically ignores outliers for domain calculation, and formats proportional values consistently.\n* Multiple tfdbg bug fixes:\n  * Fixed Windows compatibility issues.\n  * Command history now persists across runs.\n  * Bug fix in graph validation related to `tf.while_loops`.\n* Java Maven fixes for bugs with Windows installation.\n* Backport fixes and improvements from external keras.\n* Keras config file handling fix.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nA.

These were never intended to be exposed. Please use the same objects through top-level `tf` module instead.\n\n# Release 1.0.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n* XLA (experimental): initial release of [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/experimental/xla/), a domain-specific compiler for TensorFlow graphs, that targets CPUs and GPUs.\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg): command-line interface and API.\n* New python 3 docker images added.\n* Made pip packages pypi compliant. TensorFlow can now be installed by `pip\n  install tensorflow` command.\n* Several python API calls have been changed to resemble NumPy more closely.\n* Android: person detection + tracking demo implementing Scalable Object\n  Detection using Deep Neural Networks.\n* New (experimental) [Java API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/java).\n* Add new Android image stylization demo based on \"A Learned Representation For Artistic Style\", and add YOLO object detector support.\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\nTo help you upgrade your existing TensorFlow Python code to match the API changes below, we have prepared a [conversion script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/compatibility).\n* TensorFlow/models have been moved to a separate github repository.\n* Division and modulus operators (/, //, %) now match Python (flooring)\n  semantics. This applies to `tf.div` and `tf.mod` as well. To obtain forced\n  integer truncation based behaviors you can use `tf.truncatediv`\n  and `tf.truncatemod`.\n* `tf.divide()` is now the recommended division function. `tf.div()` will\n  remain, but its semantics do not respond to Python 3 or `from future`\n  mechanisms.\n* tf.reverse() now takes indices of axes to be reversed. E.g.\n  `tf.reverse(a, [True, False, True])` must now be written as\n  `tf.reverse(a, [0, 2])`. `tf.reverse_v2()` will remain until 1.0 final.\n* `tf.mul`, `tf.sub` and `tf.neg` are deprecated in favor of `tf.multiply`,\n  `tf.subtract` and `tf.negative`.\n* `tf.pack` and `tf.unpack` are deprecated in favor of `tf.stack` and\n  `tf.unstack`.\n* `TensorArray.pack` and `TensorArray.unpack` are getting deprecated in favor of\n  `TensorArray.stack` and `TensorArray.unstack`.\n* The following Python functions have had their arguments changed to use `axis`\n  when referring to specific dimensions. We have kept the old keyword arguments\n  for compatibility currently, but we will be removing them well before the\n  final 1.0.\n  * `tf.argmax`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.argmin`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.count_nonzero`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.expand_dims`: `dim` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_all`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_any`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_join`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_logsumexp`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_max`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_mean`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_min`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_prod`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_sum`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reverse_sequence`: `batch_dim` becomes `batch_axis`, `seq_dim` becomes `seq_axis`\n  * `tf.sparse_concat`: `concat_dim` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.sparse_reduce_sum`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.sparse_split`: `split_dim` becomes `axis`\n* `tf.listdiff` has been renamed to `tf.setdiff1d` to match NumPy naming.\n* `tf.inv` has been renamed to be `tf.reciprocal` (component-wise reciprocal)\n  to avoid confusion with `np.inv` which is matrix inversion\n* tf.round now uses banker's rounding (round to even) semantics to match NumPy.\n* `tf.split` now takes arguments in a reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular, we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.split(value, num_or_size_splits, axis)`.\n* `tf.sparse_split` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.sparse_split(sp_input, num_split, axis)`. NOTE: we have temporarily\n  made `tf.sparse_split` require keyword arguments.\n* `tf.concat` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as `tf.concat(values, axis, name)`.\n* `tf.image.decode_jpeg` by default uses the faster DCT method, sacrificing\n  a little fidelity for improved speed. One can revert to the old\n  behavior by specifying the attribute `dct_method='INTEGER_ACCURATE'`.\n* `tf.complex_abs` has been removed from the Python interface. `tf.abs`\n  supports complex tensors and should be used instead.\n* In the C++ API (in tensorflow/cc), Input, Output, etc. have moved\n  from the tensorflow::ops namespace to tensorflow.\n* Template.`var_scope` property renamed to `.variable_scope`\n* SyncReplicasOptimizer is removed and SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 renamed to SyncReplicasOptimizer.\n* `tf.zeros_initializer()` and `tf.ones_initializer()` now return a callable\n  that must be called with initializer arguments, in your code replace\n  `tf.zeros_initializer` with `tf.zeros_initializer()`.\n* `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for\n  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.\n* Replace tf.scalar_summary, tf.histogram_summary, tf.audio_summary, tf.image_summary with tf.summary.scalar, tf.summary.histogram, tf.summary.audio, tf.summary.image, respectively. The new summary ops take name rather than tag as their first argument, meaning summary ops now respect TensorFlow name scopes.\n* Replace tf.train.SummaryWriter and tf.train.SummaryWriterCache with tf.summary.FileWriter and tf.summary.FileWriterCache.\n* Removes RegisterShape from public API. Use C++ shape function registration\n  instead.\n* Deprecated `_ref` dtypes from the python API.\n* In the C++ API (in tensorflow/cc), Input, Output, etc. have moved\n  from the tensorflow::ops namespace to tensorflow.\n* Change arg order for `{softmax,sparse_softmax,sigmoid}_cross_entropy_with_logits` to be (labels, predictions), and force use of named args.\n* tf.nn.rnn_cell.* and most functions in tf.nn.rnn.* (with the exception of dynamic_rnn and raw_rnn) are temporarily in tf.contrib.rnn.  They will be moved back into core for TF 1.2.\n* `tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss` and `tf.nn.nce_loss` have both changed their API such that you need to switch the `inputs, labels` to `labels, inputs` parameters.\n* The shape keyword argument of the `SparseTensor` constructor changes its name to `dense_shape` between Tensorflow 0.12 and Tensorflow 1.0.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* Numerous C++ API updates.\n* New op: `parallel_stack`.\n* Introducing common tf io compression options constants for\n  RecordReader/RecordWriter.\n* Add `sparse_column_with_vocabulary_file`, to specify a feature column that\n  transform string features to IDs, where the mapping is defined by a vocabulary\n  file.\n* Added `index_to_string_table` which returns a lookup table that maps indices to\n  strings.\n* Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n* Add a `ParallelForWithWorkerId` function.\n* Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n* Support restore session from checkpoint files in v2 in `contrib/session_bundle`.\n* Added a tf.contrib.image.rotate function for arbitrary angles.\n* Added `tf.contrib.framework.filter_variables` as a convenience function to\n  filter lists of variables based on regular expressions.\n* `make_template()` takes an optional `custom_getter_ param`.\n* Added comment about how existing directories are handled by\n  `recursive_create_dir`.\n* Added an op for QR factorizations.\n* Divides and mods in Python API now use flooring (Python) semantics.\n* Android: pre-built libs are now built nightly.\n* Android: cmake/gradle build for TensorFlow Inference library under\n  `contrib/android/cmake`\n* Android: Much more robust Session initialization code.\n* Android: TF stats now exposed directly in demo and log when debug mode is\n  active\n* Android: new/better README.md documentation\n* saved_model is available as `tf.saved_model`.\n* Empty op is now stateful.\n* Improve speed of scatter_update on the cpu for ASSIGN operations.\n* Change `reduce_join` to treat `reduction_indices` in the same way as other `reduce_` ops.\n* Move `TensorForestEstimator` to `contrib/tensor_forest`.\n* Enable compiler optimizations by default and allow configuration in configure.\n* `tf.divide` now honors the name field.\n* Make metrics weight broadcasting more strict.\n* Add new queue-like `StagingArea` and new ops: `stage` and `unstage`.\n* Enable inplace update ops for strings on CPU. Speed up string concat.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAaron Hu, Abhishek Aggarwal, Adam Michael, Adriano Carmezim, @AfirSraftGarrier,\nAlexander Novikov, Alexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andrew Gibiansky, Andrew Hundt,\nAnish Shah, Anton Loss, @b0noI, @BoyuanJiang, Carl Thom\u00e9, Chad Kennedy, Comic\nChang, Connor Braa, Daniel N.

Supported languages include Python (via a\n  pip package) and C++. CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1 are supported for GPU\n  acceleration. Known limitations include: It is not currently possible to load\n  a custom op library. The GCS and HDFS file systems are not currently\n  supported. The following ops are not currently implemented:\n  Dequantize, QuantizeAndDequantize, QuantizedAvgPool,\n  QuantizedBatchNomWithGlobalNormalization, QuantizedBiasAdd, QuantizedConcat,\n  QuantizedConv2D, QuantizedMatmul, QuantizedMaxPool,\n  QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange, QuantizedRelu, QuantizedRelu6, QuantizedReshape,\n  QuantizeV2, RequantizationRange, and Requantize.\n* Go: Experimental API in Go to create and execute graphs\n  (https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)\n* New checkpoint format becomes the default in `tf.train.Saver`. Old V1\n  checkpoints continue to be readable; controlled by the `write_version`\n  argument, `tf.train.Saver` now by default writes out in the new V2\n  format. It significantly reduces the peak memory required and latency\n  incurred during restore.\n* Added a new library for library of matrix-free (iterative) solvers for linear\n  equations, linear least-squares, eigenvalues and singular values in\n  tensorflow/contrib/solvers. Initial version has lanczos bidiagonalization,\n  conjugate gradients and CGLS.\n* Added gradients for `matrix_solve_ls` and `self_adjoint_eig`.\n* Large cleanup to add second order gradient for ops with C++ gradients and\n  improve existing gradients such that most ops can now be differentiated\n  multiple times.\n* Added a solver for ordinary differential equations,\n  `tf.contrib.integrate.odeint`.\n* New contrib module for tensors with named axes, `tf.contrib.labeled_tensor`.\n* Visualization of embeddings in TensorBoard.\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n\n* `BusAdjacency` enum replaced with a protocol buffer `DeviceLocality`.  PCI bus\n  indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and `bus_id==0` is used where\n  previously `BUS_ANY` was used.\n* `Env::FileExists` and `FileSystem::FileExists` now return a tensorflow::Status\n  instead of a bool. Any callers to this function can be converted to a bool\n  by adding .ok() to the call.\n* The C API type `TF_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF_Session`,\n  indicating its preferred use in language bindings for TensorFlow.\n  What was previously `TF_Session` has been renamed to `TF_DeprecatedSession`.\n* Renamed `TF_Port` to `TF_Output` in the C API.\n* Removes RegisterShape from public API. Use C++ shape function registration instead.\n  indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and `bus_id==0` is used where\n  previously `BUS_ANY` was used.\n* Most RNN cells and RNN functions now use different variable scopes to be\n  consistent with layers (`tf.contrib.layers`).  This means old checkpoints\n  written using this code will not load after this change without providing\n  `Saver` a list of variable renames.  Examples of variable scope changes\n  include `RNN` -> `rnn` in `tf.nn.rnn`, `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` and moving from\n  `Linear/Matrix` -> `weights` and `Linear/Bias` -> `biases` in most RNN cells.\n* Deprecated tf.select op. tf.where should be used instead.\n* `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for\n  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.\n* `Env::FileExists` and `FileSystem::FileExists` now return a\n  `tensorflow::Status` instead of a bool. Any callers to this function can be\n  converted to a bool by adding `.ok()` to the call.\n* C API: Type `TF_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF_Session`, indicating\n  its preferred use in language bindings for TensorFlow. What was previously\n  `TF_Session` has been renamed to `TF_DeprecatedSession`.\n* C API: Renamed `TF_Port` to `TF_Output`.\n* C API: The caller retains ownership of `TF_Tensor` objects provided to\n  `TF_Run`, `TF_SessionRun`, `TF_SetAttrTensor` etc.\n* Renamed `tf.image.per_image_whitening()` to\n  `tf.image.per_image_standardization()`\n* Move Summary protobuf constructors to `tf.summary` submodule.\n* Deprecate `histogram_summary`, `audio_summary`, `scalar_summary`,\n  `image_summary`, `merge_summary`, and `merge_all_summaries`.\n* Combined `batch_*` and regular version of linear algebra and FFT ops. The\n  regular op now handles batches as well. All `batch_*` Python interfaces were\n  removed.\n* `tf.all_variables`, `tf.VARIABLES` and `tf.initialize_all_variables` renamed\n  to `tf.global_variables`, `tf.GLOBAL_VARIABLES` and\n  `tf.global_variables_initializer` respectively.\n* `tf.zeros_initializer()` and `tf.ones_initializer()` now return a callable\n  that must be called with initializer arguments, in your code replace\n  `tf.zeros_initializer` with `tf.zeros_initializer()`\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n* Use threadsafe version of `lgamma` function.\n* Fix `tf.sqrt` handling of negative arguments.\n* Fixed bug causing incorrect number of threads to be used for multi-threaded\n  benchmarks.\n* Performance optimizations for `batch_matmul` on multi-core CPUs.\n* Improve trace, `matrix_set_diag`, `matrix_diag_part` and their gradients to\n  work for rectangular matrices.\n* Support for SVD of complex valued matrices.\n\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n@a7744hsc, Abhi Agg, @admcrae, Adriano Carmezim, Aki Sukegawa, Alex Kendall,\nAlexander Rosenberg Johansen, @amcrae, Amlan Kar, Andre Simpelo, Andreas Eberle,\nAndrew Hundt, Arnaud Lenglet, @b0noI, Balachander Ramachandran, Ben Barsdell,\nBen Guidarelli, Benjamin Mularczyk, Burness Duan, @c0g, Changming Sun,\n@chanis, Corey Wharton, Dan J, Daniel Trebbien, Darren Garvey, David Brailovsky,\nDavid Jones, Di Zeng, @DjangoPeng, Dr. Kashif Rasul, @drag0, Fabrizio (Misto)\nMilo, Fabr\u00edCio Ceschin, @fp, @Ghedeon, @guschmue, G\u00f6k\u00e7en Eraslan, Haosdent\nHuang, Haroen Viaene, Harold Cooper, Henrik Holst, @hoangmit, Ivan Ukhov, Javier\nDehesa, Jingtian Peng, Jithin Odattu, Joan Pastor, Johan Mathe, Johannes Mayer,\nJongwook Choi, Justus Schwabedal, Kai Wolf, Kamil Hryniewicz, Kamran Amini,\nKaren Brems, Karl Lattimer, @kborer, Ken Shirriff, Kevin Rose, Larissa Laich,\nLaurent Mazare, Leonard Lee, Liang-Chi Hsieh, Liangliang He, Luke Iwanski,\nMarek Kolodziej, Moustafa Alzantot, @MrQianjinsi, @nagachika, Neil Han, Nick\nMeehan, Niels Ole Salscheider, Nikhil Mishra, @nschuc, Ondrej Skopek, Ond\u0159Ej\nFilip, @OscarDPan, Pablo Moyano, Przemyslaw Tredak, @qitaishui, @Quarazy,\n@raix852, Philipp Helo, Sam Abrahams, @SriramRamesh, Till Hoffmann, Tushar Soni,\n@tvn, @tyfkda, Uwe Schmidt, Victor Villas, Vit Stepanovs, Vladislav Gubarev,\n@wujingyue, Xuesong Yang, Yi Liu, Yilei Yang, @youyou3, Yuan (Terry) Tang,\nYuming Wang, Zafar Takhirov, @zhongyuk, Ziming Dong, @guotong1988\n\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.\n\n# Release 0.11.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* CUDA 8 support.\n* cuDNN 5 support.\n* HDFS Support.\n* Adds Fused LSTM support via cuDNN 5 in `tensorflow/contrib/cudnn_rnn`.\n* Improved support for NumPy style basic slicing including non-1 strides,\n  ellipses, newaxis, and negative indices. For example complicated expressions\n  like `foo[1, 2:4, tf.newaxis, ..., :-3:-1, :]` are now supported. In addition\n  we have preliminary (non-broadcasting) support for sliced assignment to\n  variables. In particular one can write `var[1:3].assign([1,11,111])`.\n* Deprecated `tf.op_scope` and `tf.variable_op_scope` in favor of a unified `tf.name_scope` and `tf.variable_scope`. The new argument order of `tf.variable_scope` is incompatible with previous versions.\n* Introducing `core/util/tensor_bundle` module: a module to efficiently\n  serialize/deserialize tensors to disk.  Will be used in TF's new checkpoint\n  format.\n* Added tf.svd for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of dense\n  matrices or batches of matrices (CPU only).\n* Added gradients for eigenvalues and eigenvectors computed using\n  `self_adjoint_eig` or `self_adjoint_eigvals`.\n* Eliminated `batch_*` methods for most linear algebra and FFT ops and promoted\n  the non-batch version of the ops to handle batches of matrices.\n* Tracing/timeline support for distributed runtime (no GPU profiler yet).\n* C API gives access to inferred shapes with `TF_GraphGetTensorNumDims` and\n  `TF_GraphGetTensorShape`.\n* Shape functions for core ops have moved to C++ via\n  `REGISTER_OP(...).SetShapeFn(...)`.  Python shape inference RegisterShape calls\n  use the C++ shape functions with `common_shapes.call_cpp_shape_fn`.  A future\n  release will remove `RegisterShape` from python.\n\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n* Documentation now includes operator overloads on Tensor and Variable.\n* `tensorflow.__git_version__` now allows users to identify the version of the\n  code that TensorFlow was compiled with. We also have\n  `tensorflow.__git_compiler__` which identifies the compiler used to compile\n  TensorFlow's core.\n* Improved multi-threaded performance of `batch_matmul`.\n* LSTMCell, BasicLSTMCell, and MultiRNNCell constructors now default to\n  `state_is_tuple=True`.  For a quick fix while transitioning to the new\n  default, simply pass the argument `state_is_tuple=False`.\n* DeviceFactory's AddDevices and CreateDevices functions now return\n  a Status instead of void.\n* Int32 elements of list(type) arguments are no longer placed in host memory by\n  default. If necessary, a list(type) argument to a kernel can be placed in host\n  memory using a HostMemory annotation.\n* `uniform_unit_scaling_initializer()` no longer takes a `full_shape` arg,\n  instead relying on the partition info passed to the initializer function when\n  it's called.\n* The NodeDef protocol message is now defined in its own file `node_def.proto`\n  `instead of graph.proto`.\n* `ops.NoGradient` was renamed `ops.NotDifferentiable`. `ops.NoGradient` will\n  be removed soon.\n* `dot.h` / DotGraph was removed (it was an early analysis tool prior\n  to TensorBoard, no longer that useful).  It remains in history\n  should someone find the code useful.\n* re2 / regexp.h was removed from being a public interface of TF.\n  Should users need regular expressions, they should depend on the RE2\n  library directly rather than via TensorFlow.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAbid K, @afshinrahimi, @AidanGG, Ajay Rao, Aki Sukegawa, Alex Rothberg,\nAlexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andrew Gibiansky, Andrew Thomas, @Appleholic,\nBastiaan Quast, Ben Dilday, Bofu Chen, Brandon Amos, Bryon Gloden, Cissp\u00ae,\n@chanis, Chenyang Liu, Corey Wharton, Daeyun Shin, Daniel Julius Lasiman, Daniel\nWaterworth, Danijar Hafner, Darren Garvey, Denis Gorbachev, @DjangoPeng,\nEgor-Krivov, Elia Palme, Eric Platon, Fabrizio Milo, Gaetan Semet,\nGeorg Nebehay, Gu Wang, Gustav Larsson, @haosdent, Harold Cooper, Hw-Zz,\n@ichuang, Igor Babuschkin, Igor Macedo Quintanilha, Ilya Edrenkin, @ironhead,\nJakub Kolodziejczyk, Jennifer Guo, Jihun Choi, Jonas Rauber, Josh Bleecher\nSnyder, @jpangburn, Jules Gagnon-Marchand, Karen Brems, @kborer, Kirill Bobyrev,\nLaurent Mazare, Longqi Yang, Malith Yapa, Maniteja Nandana, Martin Englund,\nMatthias Winkelmann, @mecab, Mu-Ik Jeon, Nand Dalal, Niels Ole Salscheider,\nNikhil Mishra, Park Jiin, Pieter De Rijk, @raix852, Ritwik Gupta, Sahil Sharma,\nSangheum Hwang, @SergejsRk, Shinichiro Hamaji, Simon Denel, @Steve, @suiyuan2009,\nTiago Jorge, Tijmen Tieleman, @tvn, @tyfkda, Wang Yang, Wei-Ting Kuo, Wenjian\nHuang, Yan Chen, @YenChenLin, Yuan (Terry) Tang, Yuncheng Li, Yunfeng Wang, Zack\nPolizzi, @zhongzyd, Ziming Dong, @perhapszzy\n\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.\n\n# Release 0.10.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* Added support for C++ shape inference\n* Added graph-construction C API\n* Major revision to the graph-construction C++ API\n* Support makefile build for iOS\n* Added Mac GPU support\n* Full version of TF-Slim available as `tf.contrib.slim`\n* Added k-Means clustering and WALS matrix factorization\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n* Allow gradient computation for scalar values.\n* Performance improvements for gRPC\n* Improved support for fp16\n* New high-level ops in tf.contrib.{layers,metrics}\n* New features for TensorBoard, such as shape display, exponential smoothing\n* Faster and more stable Google Cloud Storage (GCS) filesystem support\n* Support for zlib compression and decompression for TFRecordReader and TFRecordWriter\n* Support for reading (animated) GIFs\n* Improved support for SparseTensor\n* Added support for more probability distributions (Dirichlet, Beta, Bernoulli, etc.)\n* Added Python interfaces to reset resource containers.\n* Many bugfixes and performance improvements\n* Many documentation fixes\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAlex Rothberg, Andrew Royer, Austin Marshall, @BlackCoal, Bob Adolf, Brian Diesel, Charles-Emmanuel Dias, @chemelnucfin, Chris Lesniewski, Daeyun Shin, Daniel Rodriguez, Danijar Hafner, Darcy Liu, Kristinn R.

Lower versions of cuda/cudnn can\n  be supported by installing from sources and setting the options\n  during ./configure\n* Fix dataset encoding example for Python3 (@danijar)\n* Fix PIP installation by not packaging protobuf as part of wheel,\n  require protobuf 3.0.0b2.\n* Fix Mac pip installation of numpy by requiring pip >= 1.10.1.\n* Improvements and fixes to Docker image.\n\n\n# Release 0.7.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* Allow using any installed Cuda >= 7.0 and cuDNN >= R2, and add support\n  for cuDNN R4\n* Added a `contrib/` directory for unsupported or experimental features,\n  including higher level `layers` module\n* Added an easy way to add and dynamically load user-defined ops\n* Built out a good suite of tests, things should break less!\n* Added `MetaGraphDef` which makes it easier to save graphs with metadata\n* Added assignments for \"Deep Learning with TensorFlow\" udacity course\n\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n* Added a versioning framework for `GraphDef`s to ensure compatibility\n* Enforced Python 3 compatibility\n* Internal changes now show up as sensibly separated commits\n* Open-sourced the doc generator\n* Un-fork Eigen\n* Simplified the `BUILD` files and cleaned up C++ headers\n* TensorFlow can now be used as a submodule in another bazel build\n* New ops (e.g., `*fft`, `*_matrix_solve`)\n* Support for more data types in many ops\n* Performance improvements\n* Various bugfixes\n* Documentation fixes and improvements\n\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n\n* `AdjustContrast` kernel deprecated, new kernel `AdjustContrastv2` takes and\n  outputs float only. `adjust_contrast` now takes all data types.\n* `adjust_brightness`'s `delta` argument is now always assumed to be in `[0,1]`\n  (as is the norm for images in floating point formats), independent of the\n  data type of the input image.\n* The image processing ops do not take `min` and `max` inputs any more, casting\n  safety is handled by `saturate_cast`, which makes sure over- and underflows\n  are handled before casting to data types with smaller ranges.\n* For C++ API users: `IsLegacyScalar` and `IsLegacyVector` are now gone from\n  `TensorShapeUtils` since TensorFlow is scalar strict within Google (for\n  example, the shape argument to `tf.reshape` can't be a scalar anymore).  The\n  open source release was already scalar strict, so outside Google `IsScalar`\n  and `IsVector` are exact replacements.\n* The following files are being removed from `tensorflow/core/public/`:\n    * `env.h` -> `../platform/env.h`\n    * `status.h` -> `../lib/core/status.h`\n    * `tensor.h` -> `../framework/tensor.h`\n    * `tensor_shape.h` -> `../framework/tensor_shape.h`\n    * `partial_tensor_shape.h` -> `../framework/partial_tensor_shape.h`\n    * `tensorflow_server.h` deleted\n* For C++ API users: `TensorShape::ShortDebugString` has been renamed to\n  `DebugString`, and the previous `DebugString` behavior is gone (it was\n  needlessly verbose and produced a confusing empty string for scalars).\n* `GraphOptions.skip_common_subexpression_elimination` has been removed. All\n  graph optimizer options are now specified via\n  `GraphOptions.OptimizerOptions`.\n* `ASSERT_OK` / `EXPECT_OK` macros conflicted with external projects, so they\n  were renamed `TF_ASSERT_OK`, `TF_EXPECT_OK`.  The existing macros are\n  currently maintained for short-term compatibility but will be removed.\n* The non-public `nn.rnn` and the various `nn.seq2seq` methods now return\n  just the final state instead of the list of all states.\n* `tf.scatter_update` now no longer guarantees that lexicographically largest\n  index be used for update when duplicate entries exist.\n* `tf.image.random_crop(image, [height, width])` is now\n  `tf.random_crop(image, [height, width, depth])`, and `tf.random_crop` works\n  for any rank (not just 3-D images).  The C++ `RandomCrop` op has been replaced\n  with pure Python.\n* Renamed `tf.test.GetTempDir` and `tf.test.IsBuiltWithCuda` to\n  `tf.test.get_temp_dir` and `tf.test.is_built_with_cuda` for PEP-8\n  compatibility.\n* `parse_example`'s interface has changed, the old interface is accessible in\n  `legacy_parse_example` (same for related functions).\n* New `Variable`s are not added to the same collection several times even if\n  a list with duplicates is passed to the constructor.\n* The Python API will now properly set the `list` member of `AttrValue` in\n  constructed `GraphDef` messages for empty lists.  The serialization of some\n  graphs will change, but the change is both forwards and backwards compatible.\n  It will break tests that compare a generated `GraphDef` to a golden serialized\n  `GraphDef` (which is discouraged).\n\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAkiomi Kamakura, Alex Vig, Alexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andre Cruz, Arun Ahuja,\nBart Coppens, Bernardo Pires, Carl Vondrick, Cesar Salgado, Chen Yu,\nChristian Jauvin, Damien Aymeric, Dan Vanderkam, Denny Britz, Dongjoon Hyun,\nEren G\u00fcven, Erik Erwitt, Fabrizio Milo, G.

Improvements mostly due\n  to moving to 32-bit indices, faster shuffling kernels.  More improvements to\n  come in later releases.\n\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n* Lots of fixes to documentation and tutorials, many contributed\n  by the public.\n\n* 271 closed issues on github issues.\n\n## Backwards-Incompatible Changes\n\n* `tf.nn.fixed_unigram_candidate_sampler` changed its default 'distortion'\n  attribute from 0.0 to 1.0.

test.main()\n"], "fixing_code": ["# Release 2.7.0\n\n<INSERT SMALL BLURB ABOUT RELEASE FOCUS AREA AND POTENTIAL TOOLCHAIN CHANGES>\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * The methods `Model.fit()`, `Model.predict()`, and `Model.evaluate()` will\n    no longer uprank input data of shape `(batch_size,)`\n    to become `(batch_size, 1)`. This enables `Model` subclasses to process\n    scalar data in their `train_step()`/`test_step()`/`predict_step()` methods.\n    Note that this change may break certain subclassed models.\n    You can revert back to the previous behavior by adding upranking yourself\n    in the `train_step()`/`test_step()`/`predict_step()` methods, e.g.\n    `if x.shape.rank == 1: x = tf.expand_dims(x, axis=-1)`.\n    Functional models as well as Sequential models built with an explicit\n    input shape are not affected.\n  * The methods `Model.to_yaml()` and `keras.models.model_from_yaml` have been\n    replaced to raise a `RuntimeError` as they can be abused to cause arbitrary\n    code execution. It is recommended to use JSON serialization instead of YAML,\n    or, a better alternative, serialize to H5.\n  * `LinearModel` and `WideDeepModel` are moved to the\n    `tf.compat.v1.keras.models.`\n    namespace (`tf.compat.v1.keras.models.LinearModel`\n    and `tf.compat.v1.keras.models.WideDeepModel`),\n    and their `experimental` endpoints\n    (`tf.keras.experimental.models.LinearModel` and\n    `tf.keras.experimental.models.WideDeepModel`) are being deprecated.\n  * RNG behavior change for all `tf.keras.initializers` classes. For any class\n    constructed with a fixed seed, it will no longer generate same value\n    when invoked multiple times. Instead, it will return different value, but a\n    determinisitic sequence. This change will make the initialize behavior align\n    between v1 and v2.\n\n* `tf.lite`:\n  * Rename fields `SignatureDef` table in schema to maximize the parity with\n    TF SavedModel's Signature concept.\n  * Deprecate Makefile builds. Makefile users need to migrate their builds to\n    CMake or Bazel. Please refer to the\n    [Build TensorFlow Lite with CMake](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_cmake)\n    and [Build TensorFlow Lite for ARM boards](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/build_arm)\n    for the migration.\n  * Deprecate tflite::OpResolver::GetDelegates and the list returned by TfLite's\n    BuiltinOpResolver::GetDelegates is now always empty. Instead, recommend\n    using new method tflite::OpResolver::GetDelegateCreators in order to achieve\n    lazy initialization on TfLite delegate instances.\n\n* TF Core:\n    *   `tf.Graph.get_name_scope()` now always returns a string, as documented.\n        Previously, when called within `name_scope(\"\")` or `name_scope(None)`\n        contexts, it returned None; now it returns the empty string.\n    *   `tensorflow/core/ir/` contains a new MLIR-based Graph dialect that is\n        isomorphic to GraphDef and will be used to replace GraphDef-based (e.g.,\n        Grappler) optimizations.\n    *   Deprecated and removed attrs() function in shape inference. All\n        attributes should be queried by name now (rather than range returned)\n        to enable changing the underlying storage there.\n    *   The following Python symbols were accidentally added in earlier versions\n        of TensorFlow and now are removed. Each symbol has a replacement that\n        should be used instead, but note the replacement's argument names are\n        different.\n        * `tf.quantize_and_dequantize_v4` (accidentally introduced in TensorFlow\n        2.4): Use `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2` instead.\n        * `tf.batch_mat_mul_v3` (accidentally introduced in TensorFlow 2.6): Use\n        `tf.linalg.matmul` instead.\n        * `tf.sparse_segment_sum_grad` (accidentally introduced in TensorFlow\n        2.6): Use `tf.raw_ops.SparseSegmentSumGrad` instead. Directly calling\n        this op is typically not necessary, as it is automatically used when\n        computing the gradient of `tf.sparse.segment_sum`.\n    *   Renaming of tensorflow::int64 to int_64_t in numerous places (the former\n        is an alias for the latter) which could result in needing to regenerate\n        selective op registration headers else execution would fail with\n        unregistered kernels error.\n\n## Known Caveats\n\n*<CAVEATS REGARDING THE RELEASE (BUT NOT BREAKING CHANGES).>\n*<ADDING/BUMPING DEPENDENCIES SHOULD GO HERE>\n*<KNOWN LACK OF SUPPORT ON SOME PLATFORM, SHOULD GO HERE>\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* Improvements to the TensorFlow debugging experience:\n  * Previously, TensorFlow error stack traces involved many internal frames,\n    which could be challenging to read through,\n    while not being actionable for end users.\n    As of TF 2.7, TensorFlow filters internal frames in most errors that it\n    raises, to keep stack traces short, readable, and focused on what's\n    actionable for end users (their own code).\n\n    This behavior can be disabled by calling\n    `tf.debugging.disable_traceback_filtering()`, and can be re-enabled via\n    `tf.debugging.enable_traceback_filtering()`. If you are debugging a\n    TensorFlow-internal issue (e.g. to prepare a TensorFlow PR), make sure\n    to disable traceback filtering. You can check whether this feature is\n    currently enabled by calling\n    `tf.debugging.is_traceback_filtering_enabled()`.\n\n    Note that this feature is only available with Python 3.7 or higher.\n\n  * Improve the informativeness of error messages raised by Keras\n    `Layer.__call__()`, by adding the full list of argument values passed to the\n    layer in every exception.\n\n*   TF1 -> TF2 Migration\n    * Introduced the `tf.compat.v1.keras.utils.track_tf1_style_variables`\n      decorator, which enables using large classes of tf1-style variable_scope,\n      `get_variable`, and `compat.v1.layer`-based components from within TF2\n      models running with TF2 behavior enabled.\n\n*  `tf.data`:\n    *   tf.data service now supports auto-sharding. Users specify the sharding\n        policy with `tf.data.experimental.service.ShardingPolicy` enum. It can\n        be one of OFF (equivalent to today's `\"parallel_epochs\"` mode), DYNAMIC\n        (equivalent to today's `\"distributed_epoch\"` mode), or one of the static\n        sharding policies: FILE, DATA, FILE_OR_DATA, or HINT (corresponding to\n        values of `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy`).\n\n        Static sharding (auto-sharding) requires the number of tf.data service\n        workers be fixed. Users need to specify the worker addresses in\n        `tensorflow.data.experimental.DispatcherConfig`.\n    *   `tf.data.experimental.service.register_dataset` now accepts optional\n        `compression` argument.\n\n*  Keras:\n  *  `tf.keras.layers.Conv` now includes a public `convolution_op` method.\n      This method can be used to simplify the implementation of Conv subclasses.\n      There are two primary ways to use this new method.  The first is to use the method directly in your own `call` method:\n      ```\n        class StandardizedConv2D(tf.keras.layers.Conv2D):\n          def call(self, inputs):\n            mean, var = tf.nn.moments(self.kernel, axes=[0, 1, 2], keepdims=True)\n            return self.convolution_op(inputs, (self.kernel - mean) / tf.sqrt(var + 1e-10))\n      ```\n      Alternatively, you can override `convolution_op`:\n      ```\n        class StandardizedConv2D(tf.keras.Layer):\n          def convolution_op(self, inputs, kernel):\n            mean, var = tf.nn.moments(kernel, axes=[0, 1, 2], keepdims=True)\n            # Author code uses std + 1e-5\n            return super().convolution_op(inputs, (kernel - mean) / tf.sqrt(var + 1e-10))\n      ```\n  * Added `merge_state()` method to `tf.keras.metrics.Metric` for use in\n    distributed computations.\n  * Added `sparse` and `ragged` options to `tf.keras.layers.TextVectorization`\n    to allow for `SparseTensor` and `RaggedTensor` outputs from the layer.\n*  distribute.experimental.rpc package:\n   * distribute.experimental.rpc package introduces APIs to create a GRPC based\n    server to register tf.function methods and a GRPC client to invoke remote\n    registered methods. RPC APIs are intended for multi-client setups i.e. server\n  and clients are started in separate binaries independently.\n\n   * Example usage to create server:\n     ```\n        server = tf.distribute.experimental.rpc.Server.create(\"grpc\", \n                \"127.0.0.1:1234\")\n        @tf.function(input_signature=[\n          tf.TensorSpec([], tf.int32),\n          tf.TensorSpec([], dtypes.int32)\n        ])\n        def _remote_multiply(a, b):\n          return tf.math.multiply(a, b)\n\n        server.register(\"multiply\", _remote_multiply)\n     ```\n    * Example usage to create client:\n      ```\n      client = tf.distribute.experimental.rpc.Client.create(\"grpc\", address)\n      a = tf.constant(2, dtype=tf.int32)\n      b = tf.constant(3, dtype=tf.int32)\n      result = client.multiply(a, b)\n      ```\n* `tf.lite`:\n  * Add experimental API `experimental_from_jax` to support conversion from Jax\n    models to TensorFlow Lite.\n  * Support uint32 data type for cast op.\n  * Add experimental quantization debugger `tf.lite.QuantizationDebugger`\n\n* Extension Types\n  * Add experimental API to define new Python classes that can be handled by\n    TensorFlow APIs.  To create an extension type, simply define a Python class\n    with `tf.experimental.ExtensionType` as its base, and use type annotations\n    to specify the type for each field.  E.g.:\n    ```\n    class MaskedTensor(tf.experimental.ExtensionType):\n      values: tf.Tensor\n      mask: tf.Tensor\n    ```\n    The `tf.ExtensionType` base class works similarly to\n    [`typing.NamedTuple`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple)\n    and [`@dataclasses.dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html#dataclasses.dataclass)\n    from the standard Python library.\n  * Extension types are supported by Keras, tf.data, TF-hub, SavedModel,\n    tf.function, control flow ops, py_function, and distribution strategy.\n  * Add \"dispatch decorators\" that can be used to override the default behavior\n    of TensorFlow ops (such as `tf.add` or `tf.concat`) when they are applied to\n    ExtensionType values.\n  * The `BatchableExtensionType` API can be used to define extension types that\n    support APIs that make use of batching, such as `tf.data.Dataset` and\n    `tf.map_fn`.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*<SIMILAR TO ABOVE SECTION, BUT FOR OTHER IMPORTANT CHANGES / BUG FIXES>\n*<IF A CHANGE CLOSES A GITHUB ISSUE, IT SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED HERE>\n*<NOTES SHOULD BE GROUPED PER AREA>\n*   TF Core:\n    * Random number generation (RNG) system\n        *   Added argument `alg` to `tf.random.stateless_*` functions to explicitly select the RNG algorithm.\n        *   Added `tf.nn.experimental.stateless_dropout`, a stateless version of `tf.nn.dropout`.\n        *   `tf.random.Generator` now can be created inside the scope of `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` and `tf.distribute.experimental.CentralStorageStrategy`.\n    * Added an experimental session config\n      `tf.experimental.disable_functional_ops_lowering` which disables\n      functional control flow op lowering optimization. This is useful when\n      executing within a portable runtime where control flow op kernels may not\n      be loaded due to selective registration.\n    * Added a new experimental argument `experimental_is_anonymous` to the\n      `__init__` function of `tf.lookup.StaticHashTable`,\n      `tf.lookup.StaticVocabularyTable`,\n      `tf.lookup.experimental.MutableHashTable` and\n      `tf.lookup.experimental.DenseHashTable`, to create the table in anonymous\n      mode. In this mode, the table resource can only be accessed via resource\n      handles (not resource names) and will be deleted automatically when all\n      resource handles pointing to it are gone.\n*   `tf.data`:\n    *   Introducing the `tf.data.experimental.at` API which provides random\n        access for input pipelines that consist of transformations that support\n        random access. The initial set of transformations that support random\n        access includes: `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices`,\n        `tf.data.Dataset.shuffle`, `tf.data.Dataset.batch`,\n        `tf.data.Dataset.shard`, `tf.data.Dataset.map`,\n        `tf.data.Dataset.range`, `tf.data.Dataset.skip`.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.Options.experimental_deterministic` API to\n        `tf.data.Options.deterministic` and deprecating the experimental\n        endpoint.\n    *   Moving autotuning options from\n        `tf.data.Options.experimental_optimization.autotune*` to a newly created\n        `tf.data.Options.autotune.*` and removing support for\n        `tf.data.Options.experimental_optimization.autotune_buffers`.\n    *   Added support for user-defined names of tf.data core Python API, which\n        can be used to disambiguate tf.data events in TF Profiler Trace Viewer.\n    *   Promoting\n        `tf.data.experimental.sample_from_datasets` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.sample_from_datasets` and deprecating the experimental\n        endpoint.\n    *   Promoting\n        `tf.data.experimental.choose_from_datasets` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.choose_from_datasets` and deprecating the experimental\n        endpoint.\n*   TF SavedModel:\n    *   Custom gradients are now saved by default. See `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions` to disable this.\n    *   The saved_model_cli's `--input_examples` inputs are now restricted to\n        python literals to avoid code injection.\n*   XLA:\n    * Added a new API that allows custom call functions to signal errors. The\n      old API will be deprecated in a future release. See\n      https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/custom_call for details.\n    * XLA:GPU reductions are deterministic by default (reductions within\n      `jit_compile=True` are now deterministic).\n    * XLA:GPU works with Horovod (OSS contribution by Trent Lo from NVidia)\n*   `tf.saved_model.save`:\n    *   When saving a model, not specifying a namespace whitelist for custom\n        ops with a namespace will now default to allowing rather than rejecting\n        them all.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n<INSERT>, <NAME>, <HERE>, <USING>, <GITHUB>, <HANDLE>\n\n# Release 2.6.0\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n*   `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite` is removed, as\n    the API only works in graph mode and is not customizable. The function is\n    still accessible under\n    `tf.compat.v1.mixed_precision.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite`, but it\n    is recommended to use the\n    [Keras mixed precision API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/mixed_precision)\n    instead.\n\n*   `tf.lite`:\n\n    *   Remove `experimental.nn.dynamic_rnn`, `experimental.nn.TfLiteRNNCell`\n        and `experimental.nn.TfLiteLSTMCell` since they're no longer supported.\n        It's recommended to just use\n        [keras lstm](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM)\n        instead.\n\n*   `tf.keras`:\n\n    *   Keras been split into a separate PIP package (`keras`), and its code has\n        been moved to the GitHub\n        repository[keras-team/keras](http://github.com/keras-team/keras). The\n        API endpoints for `tf.keras` stay unchanged, but are now backed by the\n        `keras` PIP package. The existing code in tensorflow/python/keras is a\n        staled copy and will be removed in future release (2.7). Please remove\n        any imports to `tensorflow.python.keras` and replace them with public\n        tf.keras API instead.\n    *   The methods `Model.to_yaml()` and `keras.models.model_from_yaml` have\n        been replaced to raise a `RuntimeError` as they can be abused to cause\n        arbitrary code execution. It is recommended to use JSON serialization\n        instead of YAML, or, a better alternative, serialize to H5.\n\n## Known Caveats\n\n*   TF Core:\n    *   A longstanding bug in `tf.while_loop`, which caused it to execute\n        sequentially, even when `parallel_iterations>1`, has now been fixed.\n        However, the increased parallelism may result in increased memory use.\n        Users who experience unwanted regressions should reset their\n        `while_loop`'s `parallel_iterations` value to 1, which is consistent\n        with prior behavior.\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n*   `tf.keras`:\n\n    *   Keras has been split into a separate PIP package (`keras`), and its code\n        has been moved to the GitHub repository\n        [keras-team/keras](http://github.com/keras-team/keras). The API\n        endpoints for `tf.keras` stay unchanged, but are now backed by the\n        `keras` PIP package. All Keras-related PRs and issues should now be\n        directed to the GitHub repository.\n        [keras-team/keras](http://github.com/keras-team/keras).\n    *   `tf.keras.utils.experimental.DatasetCreator` now takes an optional\n        `tf.distribute.InputOptions` for specific options when used with\n        distribution.\n    *   `tf.keras.experimental.SidecarEvaluator` is now available for a program\n        intended to be run on an evaluator task, which is commonly used to\n        supplement a training cluster running with\n        `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` (see\n        `https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training).\n        It can also be used with single-worker training or other strategies. See\n        docstring for more info.\n    *   Preprocessing layers moved from experimental to core.\n        *   Import paths moved from `tf.keras.layers.preprocessing.experimental`\n            to `tf.keras.layers`.\n    *   Updates to Preprocessing layers API for consistency and clarity:\n        *   `StringLookup` and `IntegerLookup` default for `mask_token` changed\n            to `None`. This matches the default masking behavior of `Hashing`\n            and `Embedding` layers. To keep existing behavior, pass\n            `mask_token=\"\"` during layer creation.\n        *   Renamed `\"binary\"` output mode to `\"multi_hot\"` for\n            `CategoryEncoding`, `StringLookup`, `IntegerLookup`, and\n            `TextVectorization`. Multi-hot encoding will no longer automatically\n            uprank rank 1 inputs, so these layers can now multi-hot encode\n            unbatched multi-dimensional samples.\n        *   Added a new output mode `\"one_hot\"` for `CategoryEncoding`,\n            `StringLookup`, `IntegerLookup`, which will encode each element in\n            an input batch individually, and automatically append a new output\n            dimension if necessary. Use this mode on rank 1 inputs for the old\n            `\"binary\"` behavior of one-hot encoding a batch of scalars.\n        *   `Normalization` will no longer automatically uprank rank 1 inputs,\n            allowing normalization of unbatched multi-dimensional samples.\n\n*   `tf.lite`:\n\n    *   The recommended Android NDK version for building TensorFlow Lite has\n        been changed from r18b to r19c.\n    *   Supports int64 for mul.\n    *   Supports native variable builtin ops - ReadVariable, AssignVariable.\n    *   Converter:\n        *   Experimental support for variables in TFLite. To enable through\n            conversion, users need to set\n            `experimental_enable_resource_variables` on tf.lite.TFLiteConverter\n            to True. Note: mutable variables is only available using\n            `from_saved_model` in this release, support for other methods is\n            coming soon.\n        *   Old Converter (TOCO) is getting removed from next release. It's been\n            deprecated for few releases already.\n    *   lite.experimental.authoring.compatible API:\n        *   A Python decorator to provide a way to check TFLite compatibility\n            issue of `tf.function`. This returns a callable object which\n            validates TFLite compatibility. If an incompatible operation is\n            encountered during execution, an exception will be raised with\n            information about the incompatible ops.\n    *   lite.experimental.Analyzer API:\n        *   An experimental tool to analyze TFLite flatbuffer models. This API\n            can be used to investigate TFLite model structure and check\n            compatibility with GPU delegate.\n\n*   `tf.saved_model`:\n\n    *   SavedModels can now save custom gradients. Use the option\n        `tf.saved_model.SaveOption(experimental_custom_gradients=True)` to\n        enable this feature. The documentation in\n        [Advanced autodiff](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/advanced_autodiff#custom_gradients)\n        has been updated.\n    *   Object metadata has now been deprecated and no longer saved to the\n        SavedModel.\n\n*   TF Core:\n\n    *   Added `tf.config.experimental.reset_memory_stats` to reset the tracked\n        peak memory returned by `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info`.\n\n*   `tf.data`:\n\n    *   Added `target_workers` param to `data_service_ops.from_dataset_id` and\n        `data_service_ops.distribute`. Users can specify `\"AUTO\"`, `\"ANY\"`, or\n        `\"LOCAL\"` (case insensitive). If `\"AUTO\"`, tf.data service runtime\n        decides which workers to read from. If `\"ANY\"`, TF workers read from any\n        tf.data service workers. If `\"LOCAL\"`, TF workers will only read from\n        local in-processs tf.data service workers. `\"AUTO\"` works well for most\n        cases, while users can specify other targets. For example, `\"LOCAL\"`\n        would help avoid RPCs and data copy if every TF worker colocates with a\n        tf.data service worker. Currently, `\"AUTO\"` reads from any tf.data\n        service workers to preserve existing behavior. The default value is\n        `\"AUTO\"`.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   TF Core:\n    *   Added `tf.lookup.experimental.MutableHashTable`, which provides a\n        generic mutable hash table implementation.\n        *   Compared to `tf.lookup.experimental.DenseHashTable` this offers\n            lower overall memory usage, and a cleaner API. It does not require\n            specifying a `delete_key` and `empty_key` that cannot be inserted\n            into the table.\n    *   Added support for specifying number of subdivisions in all reduce host\n        collective. This parallelizes work on CPU and speeds up the collective\n        performance. Default behavior is unchanged.\n    *   Add an option `perturb_singular` to `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve` that\n        allows solving linear systems with a numerically singular tridiagonal\n        matrix, e.g. for use in inverse iteration.\n    *   Added `tf.linalg.eigh_tridiagonal` that computes the eigenvalues of a\n        Hermitian tridiagonal matrix.\n    *   `tf.constant` now places its output on the current default device.\n    *   SavedModel\n        *   Added `tf.saved_model.experimental.TrackableResource`, which allows\n            the creation of custom wrapper objects for resource tensors.\n        *   Added a SavedModel load option to allow restoring partial\n            checkpoints into the SavedModel. See\n            [`tf.saved_model.LoadOptions`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/LoadOptions)\n            for details.\n    *   Added a new op `SparseSegmentSumGrad` to match the other sparse segment\n        gradient ops and avoid an extra gather operation that was in the\n        previous gradient implementation.\n    *   Added a new session config setting `internal_fragmentation_fraction`,\n        which controls when the BFC Allocator needs to split an oversized chunk\n        to satisfy an allocation request.\n    *   Added `tf.get_current_name_scope()` which returns the current full name\n        scope string that will be prepended to op names.\n*   `tf.data`:\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.bucket_by_sequence_length` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.bucket_by_sequence_length` and deprecating the\n        experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.get_single_element` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.get_single_element` and deprecating the experimental\n        endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.group_by_window` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.group_by_window` and deprecating the experimental\n        endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.RandomDataset` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.random` and deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.scan` API to `tf.data.Dataset.scan` and\n        deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.snapshot` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.shapshot` and deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.take_while` API to\n        `tf.data.Dataset.take_while` and deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.ThreadingOptions` API to\n        `tf.data.ThreadingOptions` and deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.unique` API to `tf.data.Dataset.unique`\n        and deprecating the experimental endpoint.\n    *   Added `stop_on_empty_dataset` parameter to `sample_from_datasets` and\n        `choose_from_datasets`. Setting `stop_on_empty_dataset=True` will stop\n        sampling if it encounters an empty dataset. This preserves the sampling\n        ratio throughout training. The prior behavior was to continue sampling,\n        skipping over exhausted datasets, until all datasets are exhausted. By\n        default, the original behavior (`stop_on_empty_dataset=False`) is\n        preserved.\n    *   Removed previously deprecated tf.data statistics related APIs:\n        *   `tf.data.Options.experimental_stats`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.StatsAggregator`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.StatsOptions.*`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.bytes_produced_stats`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.latency_stats`\n    *   Removed the following experimental tf.data optimization APIs:\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.MapVectorizationOptions.*`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions.filter_with_random_uniform_fusion`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions.hoist_random_uniform`\n        *   `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions.map_vectorization` *\n            `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions.reorder_data_discarding_ops`\n*   `tf.keras`:\n    *   Fix usage of `__getitem__` slicing in Keras Functional APIs when the\n        inputs are `RaggedTensor` objects.\n    *   Add `keepdims` argument to all `GlobalPooling` layers.\n    *   Add `include_preprocessing` argument to `MobileNetV3` architectures to\n        control the inclusion of `Rescaling` layer in the model.\n    *   Add optional argument (`force`) to `make_(train|test|predict)_funtion`\n        methods to skip the cached function and generate a new one. This is\n        useful to regenerate in a single call the compiled training function\n        when any `.trainable` attribute of any model's layer has changed.\n    *   Models now have a `save_spec` property which contains the `TensorSpec`\n        specs for calling the model. This spec is automatically saved when the\n        model is called for the first time.\n*   `tf.linalg`:\n    *   Add `CompositeTensor` as a base class to `LinearOperator`.\n*   `tf.lite`:\n    *   Fix mean op reference quantization rounding issue.\n    *   Added `framework_stable` BUILD target, which links in only the\n        non-experimental TF Lite APIs.\n    *   Remove deprecated Java `Interpreter` methods:\n        *   `modifyGraphWithDelegate` - Use `Interpreter.Options.addDelegate`\n        *   `setNumThreads` - Use `Interpreter.Options.setNumThreads`\n    *   Add Conv3DTranspose as a builtin op.\n*   `tf.summary`:\n    *   Fix `tf.summary.should_record_summaries()` so it correctly reflects when\n        summaries will be written, even when `tf.summary.record_if()` is not n\n        effect, by returning True tensor if default writer is present.\n*   Grappler:\n    *   Disable default Grappler optimization timeout to make the optimization\n        pipeline deterministic. This may lead to increased model loading time,\n        because time spent in graph optimizations is now unbounded (was 20\n        minutes).\n*   Deterministic Op Functionality (enabled by setting `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to\n    `\"true\"` or `\"1\"`):\n    *   Add a deterministic GPU implementation of\n        `tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`. See PR\n        [49178](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/49178).\n    *   Add a deterministic CPU implementation of `tf.image.crop_and_resize`.\n        See PR [48905](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/48905).\n    *   Add determinism-unimplemented exception-throwing to the following ops.\n        When op-determinism is expected, an attempt to use the specified paths\n        through the following ops on a GPU will cause\n        `tf.errors.UnimplementedError` (with an understandable message) to be\n        thrown.\n        *   `tf.nn.sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` forwards and/or\n            backwards. See PR\n            [47925](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/47925).\n        *   `tf.image.crop_and_resize` gradient w.r.t. either `image` or\n            `boxes`. See PR\n            [48905](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/48905).\n        *   `tf.sparse.sparse_dense_matmul` forwards. See PR\n            [50355](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/50355).\n\n## Security\n\n*   Fixes a heap out of bounds access in sparse reduction operations\n

Major Features and Improvements\n\n*   Support for Python3.9 has been added.\n*   `tf.data`:\n    *   `tf.data` service now supports strict round-robin reads, which is useful\n        for synchronous training workloads where example sizes vary. With strict\n        round robin reads, users can guarantee that consumers get similar-sized\n        examples in the same step.\n    *   tf.data service now supports optional compression. Previously data would\n        always be compressed, but now you can disable compression by passing\n        `compression=None` to `tf.data.experimental.service.distribute(...)`.\n    *   `tf.data.Dataset.batch()` now supports `num_parallel_calls` and\n        `deterministic` arguments. `num_parallel_calls` is used to indicate that\n        multiple input batches should be computed in parallel. With\n        `num_parallel_calls` set, `deterministic` is used to indicate that\n        outputs can be obtained in the non-deterministic order.\n    *   Options returned by `tf.data.Dataset.options()` are no longer mutable.\n    *   tf.data input pipelines can now be executed in debug mode, which\n        disables any asynchrony, parallelism, or non-determinism and forces\n        Python execution (as opposed to trace-compiled graph execution) of\n        user-defined functions passed into transformations such as `map`. The\n        debug mode can be enabled through\n        `tf.data.experimental.enable_debug_mode()`.\n*   `tf.lite`\n    *   Enabled the new MLIR-based quantization backend by default\n        *   The new backend is used for 8 bits full integer post-training\n            quantization\n        *   The new backend removes the redundant rescales and fixes some bugs\n            (shared weight/bias, extremely small scales, etc)\n        *   Set `experimental_new_quantizer` in tf.lite.TFLiteConverter to False\n            to disable this change\n*   `tf.keras`\n    *   `tf.keras.metrics.AUC` now support logit predictions.\n    *   Enabled a new supported input type in `Model.fit`,\n        `tf.keras.utils.experimental.DatasetCreator`, which takes a callable,\n        `dataset_fn`. `DatasetCreator` is intended to work across all\n        `tf.distribute` strategies, and is the only input type supported for\n        Parameter Server strategy.\n*   `tf.distribute`\n    *   `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` now supports\n        training with Keras `Model.fit` when used with `DatasetCreator`.\n    *   Creating `tf.random.Generator` under `tf.distribute.Strategy` scopes is\n        now allowed (except for\n        `tf.distribute.experimental.CentralStorageStrategy` and\n        `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`). Different\n        replicas will get different random-number streams.\n*   TPU embedding support\n    *   Added `profile_data_directory` to `EmbeddingConfigSpec` in\n        `_tpu_estimator_embedding.py`. This allows embedding lookup statistics\n        gathered at runtime to be used in embedding layer partitioning\n        decisions.\n*   PluggableDevice\n    *   Third-party devices can now connect to TensorFlow as plug-ins through\n        [StreamExecutor C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200612-stream-executor-c-api.md).\n        and\n        [PluggableDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200624-pluggable-device-for-tensorflow.md)\n        interface.\n        *   Add custom ops and kernels through\n            [kernel and op registration C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190814-kernel-and-op-registration.md).\n        *   Register custom graph optimization passes with\n            [graph optimization C API](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20201027-modular-tensorflow-graph-c-api.md).\n*   [oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN)\n    CPU performance optimizations from\n    [Intel-optimized TensorFlow](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-optimization-for-tensorflow-installation-guide.html)\n    are now available in the official x86-64 Linux and Windows builds.\n    *   They are off by default. Enable them by setting the environment variable\n        `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=1`.\n    *   We do not recommend using them in GPU systems, as they have not been\n        sufficiently tested with GPUs yet.\n*   TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11.2 and cuDNN 8.1.0\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n*   The `TF_CPP_MIN_VLOG_LEVEL` environment variable has been renamed to to\n    `TF_CPP_MAX_VLOG_LEVEL` which correctly describes its effect.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   `tf.keras`:\n\n    *   Preprocessing layers API consistency changes:\n        *   `StringLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and\n            `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as\n            `TextVectorization`.\n        *   `IntegerLookup` added `output_mode`, `sparse`, and\n            `pad_to_max_tokens` arguments with same semantics as\n            `TextVectorization`. Renamed `max_values`, `oov_value` and\n            `mask_value` to `max_tokens`, `oov_token` and `mask_token` to align\n            with `StringLookup` and `TextVectorization`.\n        *   `TextVectorization` default for `pad_to_max_tokens` switched to\n            False.\n        *   `CategoryEncoding` no longer supports `adapt`, `IntegerLookup` now\n            supports equivalent functionality. `max_tokens` argument renamed to\n            `num_tokens`.\n        *   `Discretization` added `num_bins` argument for learning bins\n            boundaries through calling `adapt` on a dataset. Renamed `bins`\n            argument to `bin_boundaries` for specifying bins without `adapt`.\n    *   Improvements to model saving/loading:\n        *   `model.load_weights` now accepts paths to saved models.\n    *   Keras inputs can now be created directly from arbitrary `tf.TypeSpecs`.\n    *   Two new learning rate schedules added:\n        `tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay`\n        and`tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecayRestarts`.\n\n*   `tf.data`:\n\n    *   Exposing `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy`, which can be used\n        to control how external state should be handled during dataset\n        serialization or iterator checkpointing.\n    *   Changing `tf.data.experimental.save` to store the type specification of\n        the dataset elements. This avoids the need for explicitly specifying the\n        `element_spec` argument of `tf.data.experimental.load` when loading the\n        previously saved dataset.\n    *   Add `.element_spec` property to `tf.data.DatasetSpec` to access the\n        inner spec. This can be used to extract the structure of nested\n        datasets.\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardingPolicy.HINT` which can be used to\n        provide hints to tf.distribute-based auto-sharding as to where in the\n        input pipeline to insert sharding transformations.\n    *   Make tf.data.Options persistent across `tf.function` and `GraphDef`\n        boundaries.\n\n*   XLA compilation:\n\n    *   `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` has become a stable API,\n        renamed `tf.function(jit_compile=True)`.\n    *   XLA can now compile MirroredStrategy: the step function passed\n        to`strategy.run` can now be annoted with `jit_compile=True`.\n\n*   `tf.distribute`:\n\n    *   Rename `experimental_prefetch_to_device` in `tf.distribute.InputOptions`\n        to `experimental_fetch_to_device` to better reflect the purpose.\n\n*   `tf.lite`:\n\n    *   class `tflite::Subgraph`:\n        *   Removed the `tensors()` method and the non-const overload of the\n            `nodes_and_registration()` method, both of which were previously\n            documented as temporary and to be removed.\n            *   Uses of `tensors()` can be replaced by calling the existing\n                methods `tensors_size()` and `tensor(int)`.\n            *   Uses of the non-const overload of `nodes_and_registration` can\n                be replaced by calling the existing methods `nodes_size()` and\n                `context()`, and then calling the `GetNodeAndRegistration`\n                method in the `TfLiteContext` returned by `context()`.\n    *   NNAPI\n        *   Removed deprecated `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API.\n            *   Use `NnApiDelegate()` and related delegate configuration methods\n                directly.\n        *   Replaced the model cache key for models computation algorithm with\n            one guaranteed to be stable across runs.\n    *   16 bits quantization\n        *   Added int16x8 support for ABS, REDUCE_MAX and REDUCE_MIN operators.\n        *   Additional tests and fixes for ADD and SUB operators.\n    *   Added support for saved model's session initializer through\n        `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\n    *   Added DEPTH_TO_SPACE support in Post training quantization.\n    *   Added dynamic range quantization support for the BatchMatMul op.\n        *   Both symmetric and asymmetric quantized input tensor are supported.\n    *   Add `RFFT2D` as builtin op. (`RFFT2D` also supports `RFFTD`.) Currently\n        only supports float32 input.\n    *   Add 5D support to `SLICE` op.\n    *   TFLite Supports SingatureDef:\n        *   TFLiteConverter exports models with SignatureDef\n        *   Interpreter supports getting a list of signatures and getting\n            callable function for a given signaturedef.\n    *   Add int8 support for `ReshapeV2`.\n    *   Add experimental support for optimization with sparsity.\n    *   Add nominal support for unsigned 32-bit integer tensor types. Note that\n        very few TFLite kernels support this type natively, so its use in mobile\n        ML authoring is generally discouraged.\n    *   Add support for static hash tables through\n        `TFLiteConverter.from_saved_model`.\n    *   The Python TF Lite Interpreter bindings now has an option\n        `experimental_preserve_all_tensors` to aid in debugging conversion.\n    *   Quantized x86 execution defaults to Ruy GEMM library for platforms with\n        AVX support.\n    *   Deprecate\n        `tf.compat.v1.lite.experimental.get_potentially_supported_ops`. Use\n        `tf.lite.TFLiteConverter` directly to check whether a model is\n        convertible.\n    *   Add support to select one of three different built-in op resolvers\n    *   Enabled post training with calibrations for models that require user\n        provided TensorFlow Lite custom op libraries via\n        `converter.target_spec._experimental_custom_op_registerers`. used in\n        Python Interpreter API.\n\n*   TF Core:\n\n    *   Corrected higher-order gradients of control flow constructs (`tf.cond`,\n        `tf.while_loop`, and compositions like `tf.foldl`) computed with\n        `tf.GradientTape` inside a `tf.function`.\n    *   Changed the default step size in `gradient_checker_v2.compute_gradients`\n        to be exactly representable as a binary floating point numbers. This\n        avoids poluting gradient approximations needlessly, which is some cases\n        leads to false negatives in op gradient tests.\n    *   Added `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_info`, returning a dict with\n        the current and peak memory usage. Deprecated\n        `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` in favor of this new function.\n    *   Extended `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution` to\n        control Tensor-Float-32 evaluation in RNNs.\n    *   Added a 'experimental_payloads' field to tf.errors.OpError and its\n        subclasses to support more detailed error reporting. This is inspired\n        from Abseil Status payloads:\n        https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/absl/status/status.h\n\n*   `tf.summary`:\n\n    *   New `tf.summary.graph` allows manual write of TensorFlow graph\n        (`tf.Graph` or `tf.compat.v1.GraphDef`) as a summary. This is not a\n        replacement for the trace-based API.\n\n*   Set `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` by default for Windows builds. This\n    provides a big compile-time speedup, and effectively raises the minimum\n    supported MSVC version to 16.4 (current: 16.8).\n\n    *   See:\n        https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/topic/build/SsW98Eo7l3o/discussion\n\n*   TensorRT\n\n    *   Removed the deprecated `session_config` parameter for the TF1-TRT\n        converter `TrtGraphConverter`. Previously, we issued a warning when the\n        value of the parameter is not None.\n    *   The TF2-TRT converter `TrtGraphConverterV2` takes an object of class\n        TrtConversionParams as a parameter. Removed three deprecated fields from\n        this class: `rewriter_config_template`, `is_dynamic_op`, and\n        `max_batch_size`. Previously, we issued a warning when the value of\n        `rewriter_config_template` is not None. We issued an error when the\n        value of `is_dynamic_op` is not True. We didn't use the value for\n        `max_batch_size` for building TensorRT engines. Add parameters\n        `use_dynamic_shape` to enable dynamic shape support. The default is to\n        disable dynamic shape support. Add `dynamic_shape_profile_strategy` for\n        selecting a dynamic shape profile strategy. The default is profile\n        strategy is `Range`.\n    *   Issue a warning when function get_tensorrt_rewriter_config is used.\n\n*   TF XLA\n\n    *   Add new enum value `MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_ENABLED` to\n        `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a \\\"safe\\\" mode.\n        This runs the MLIR bridge only when an analysis of the graph only when\n        an analysis of the graph determines that it is safe to run.\n    *   Add new enum value `MLIR_BRIDGE_ROLLOUT_SAFE_MODE_FALLBACK_ENABLED'\n        to`tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` to enable a fallback for\n        the MLIR bridge in a \\\"safe\\\" mode. This runs the MLIR bridge in a\n        FallbackEnabled mode when an analysis of the graph determines that the\n        graph does not have unsupported features.\n\n*   Deterministic Op Functionality:\n\n    *   Add determinism-unimplemented exception-throwing to the segment-sum ops.\n        When the environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` is set to `\"true\"`\n        or `\"1\"` (when op-determinism is expected), an attempt to run the\n        following ops on a GPU will throw `tf.errors.UnimplementedError` (with\n        an understandable message) when `data` is a floating-point type,\n        including complex types (if supported): `tf.math.segment_prod`,\n        `tf.math.segment_sum`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_mean`,\n        `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sqrt_n`, `tf.math.unsorted_segment_prod`,\n        `tf.math.unsorted_segment_sum`, and therefore also\n        `tf.convert_to_tensor` when `value` is of type `tf.IndexedSlices` (such\n        as in the back prop though `tf.gather` into a dense embedding). See\n        issue [39751](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/39751)\n        which this change addresses, but does not solve. This exception-throwing\n        behavior can be disabled by setting the environment variable\n        `TF_DISABLE_SEGMENT_REDUCTION_OP_DETERMINISM_EXCEPTIONS` to `\"true\"` or\n        `\"1\"`. For more information about these changes, see the description in\n        pull request\n        [47772](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/47772).\n    *   In previous versions of TensorFlow, when a GPU was available,\n        `tf.sparse.sparse_dense_matmul` introduced truly random noise in the\n        forward path for data of type `tf.float32` but not for data of type\n        `tf.float64` (for which there was no GPU implementation). In this\n        current release, GPU support for other floating-point types\n        (`tf.float16`, `tf.float64`, `tf.complex64`, and `tf.complex128`) has\n        been added for this op. If you were relying on the determinism of the\n        `tf.float64` CPU implementation being automatically selected because of\n        the absence of the `tf.float64` GPU implementation, you with either need\n        to force the op to run on the CPU or use a different data type.\n\n*   Security\n\n    *   Fixes a heap buffer overflow in `RaggedBinCount`\n

`3.44.0` to keep in sync with master branch.\n\n# Release 2.4.0\n\n ## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* `tf.distribute` introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of\n  models via the [`tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/ParameterServerStrategy)\n  API. Please see the [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/parameter_server_training)\n  to learn more.\n\n* [`MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy)\n  is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the\n  major improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please\n  check out the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worker training with Keras]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).\n\n* Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy) which is a\n  NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. See the [detailed guide]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/tf_numpy) to learn more. Additional details below.\n\n* Adds Support for\n  [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/)\n  on Ampere based GPUs. TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for\n  NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs and is enabled by default.\n\n* A major refactoring of the internals of the Keras Functional API has been\n  completed, that should improve the reliability, stability, and performance of\n  constructing Functional models.\n\n* Keras mixed precision API [`tf.keras.mixed_precision`]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision?version=nightly)\n  is no longer experimental and allows the use of 16-bit floating point formats\n  during training, improving performance by up to 3x on GPUs and 60% on TPUs.\n  Please see below for additional details.\n\n* TensorFlow Profiler now supports profiling `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` and\n  tracing multiple workers using the [sampling mode API]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#profiling_apis).\n\n* TFLite Profiler for Android is available. See the detailed [guide]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/measurement#trace_tensorflow_lite_internals_in_android)\n  to learn more.\n\n* TensorFlow pip packages are now built with CUDA11 and cuDNN 8.0.2.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n* TF Core:\n  * Certain float32 ops run in lower precision on Ampere based GPUs, including\n  matmuls and convolutions, due to the use of [TensorFloat-32]\n  (https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/).\n  Specifically, inputs to such ops are rounded from 23 bits of precision to 10\n  bits of precision. This is unlikely to cause issues in practice for deep learning\n  models. In some cases, TensorFloat-32 is also used for complex64 ops.\n  TensorFloat-32 can be disabled by running `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution(False)`.\n  * The byte layout for string tensors across the C-API has been updated to match\n  TF Core/C++; i.e., a contiguous array of `tensorflow::tstring`/`TF_TString`s.\n  * C-API functions `TF_StringDecode`, `TF_StringEncode`, and `TF_StringEncodedSize`\n  are no longer relevant and have been removed; see `core/platform/ctstring.h` for\n  string access/modification in C.\n  * `tensorflow.python`, `tensorflow.core` and `tensorflow.compiler` modules are\n  now hidden. These modules are not part of TensorFlow public API.\n  * `tf.raw_ops.Max` and `tf.raw_ops.Min` no longer accept inputs of type\n  `tf.complex64` or `tf.complex128`, because the behavior of these ops is not\n  well defined for complex types.\n  * XLA:CPU and XLA:GPU devices are no longer registered by default. Use\n  `TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` if you really need them, but this\n  flag will eventually be removed in subsequent releases.\n\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * The `steps_per_execution` argument in `model.compile()` is no longer experimental;\n  if you were passing `experimental_steps_per_execution`, rename it to\n  `steps_per_execution` in your code. This argument controls the number of batches\n  to run during each `tf.function` call when calling `model.fit()`. Running multiple\n  batches inside a single `tf.function` call can greatly improve performance on\n  TPUs or small models with a large Python overhead.\n  * A **major refactoring** of the internals of the Keras Functional API may affect code that\n  is relying on certain internal details:\n    * Code that uses `isinstance(x, tf.Tensor)` instead of `tf.is_tensor` when\n  checking Keras symbolic inputs/outputs should switch to using `tf.is_tensor`.\n    * Code that is overly dependent on the exact names attached to symbolic tensors\n  (e.g. assumes there will be \":0\" at the end of the inputs, treats names as\n  unique identifiers instead of using `tensor.ref()`, etc.) may break.\n    * Code that uses full path for `get_concrete_function` to trace Keras symbolic\n  inputs directly should switch to building matching `tf.TensorSpec`s directly and\n  tracing the `TensorSpec` objects.\n    * Code that relies on the exact number and names of the op layers that TensorFlow\n  operations  were converted into may have changed.\n    * Code that uses `tf.map_fn`/`tf.cond`/`tf.while_loop`/control flow as op layers\n  and  happens to work before TF 2.4. These will explicitly be unsupported now.\n  Converting these ops to Functional API op layers was unreliable before TF 2.4,\n  and prone to erroring incomprehensibly  or being silently buggy.\n    * Code that directly asserts on a Keras symbolic value in cases where ops\n  like `tf.rank` used to  return a static or symbolic value depending on if the\n  input had a fully static shape or not. Now these ops always return symbolic values.\n    * Code already susceptible to leaking tensors outside of graphs becomes slightly\n  more likely to do so now.\n    * Code that tries directly getting gradients with respect to symbolic Keras\n  inputs/outputs. Use `GradientTape` on the actual Tensors passed to the already-constructed\n  model instead.\n    * Code that requires very tricky shape manipulation via converted op layers\n  in order to work, where the Keras symbolic shape inference proves insufficient.\n    * Code that tries manually walking a `tf.keras.Model` layer by layer and assumes\n  layers only ever have one positional argument. This assumption doesn't hold\n  true before TF 2.4 either, but is more likely to cause issues now.\n    * Code that manually enters `keras.backend.get_graph()` before building a\n  functional model is no longer needed.\n    * Start enforcing input shape assumptions when calling Functional API Keras\n  models. This may potentially break some users, in case there is a mismatch\n  between the shape used when creating `Input` objects in a Functional model,\n  and the shape of the data passed to that model. You can fix this mismatch by\n  either calling the model with correctly-shaped data, or by relaxing `Input` shape\n  assumptions (note that you can pass shapes with `None` entries for axes that\n  are meant to be dynamic). You can also disable the input checking entirely by\n  setting `model.input_spec = None`.\n  * Several changes have been made to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental`.\n  Note that it is now recommended to use the non-experimental\n  `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API.\n   * `AutoCastVariable.dtype` now refers to the actual variable dtype, not the\n  dtype it will be casted to.\n   * When mixed precision is enabled, `tf.keras.layers.Embedding` now outputs a\n  float16 or bfloat16 tensor instead of a float32 tensor.\n   * The property `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer.loss_scale`\n  is now a tensor, not a `LossScale` object. This means to get a loss scale\n  of a `LossScaleOptimizer` as a tensor, you must now call `opt.loss_scale`instead of `opt.loss_scale()`.\n   * The property `should_cast_variables` has been removed from `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.Policy`\n   * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`,\n  the `DynamicLossScale`'s multiplier must be 2.\n   * When passing a `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.DynamicLossScale` to\n  `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`, the weights of\n  the `DynanmicLossScale` are copied into the `LossScaleOptimizer` instead of being reused.\n  This means modifying the weights of the `DynamicLossScale` will no longer affect the weights of the LossScaleOptimizer, and vice versa.\n   * The global policy can no longer be set to a non-floating point policy in `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy`\n   * In `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will no longer be casted within\n  `MirroredStrategy.run` or `ReplicaContext.merge_call`. This is because a thread local\n  variable is used to determine whether `AutoCastVariable`s are casted, and those\n  two functions run with a different thread. Note this only applies if one of\n  these two functions is called within `Layer.call`; if one of those two functions calls `Layer.call`, `AutoCastVariable`s will still be casted.\n\n* `tf.data`:\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer` now takes a config tuple\n  instead of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to\n  `tf.data.experimental.service.DispatchServer(dispatcher_config)`.\n  * `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer` now takes a config tuple instead\n  of individual arguments. Usages should be updated to  `tf.data.experimental.service.WorkerServer(worker_config)`.\n\n* `tf.distribute`:\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_make_numpy_dataset`. Please use\n  `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` instead.\n  * Renames `experimental_hints` in `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.reduce_to`,\n  `tf.distribute.StrategyExtended.batch_reduce_to`, `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_reduce`\n  to `options`.\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveHints` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationOptions`.\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.experimental.CollectiveCommunication` to `tf.distribute.experimental.CommunicationImplementation`.\n  * Renames `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function` to `distribute_datasets_from_function` as it is no longer experimental.\n  * Removes `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_run_v2` method, which was deprecated in TF 2.2.\n\n* `tf.lite`:\n  * `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2` has been introduced, which updates the gradient definition for quantization which is outside the range\n     to be 0. To simulate the V1 the behavior of `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize(...)` use\n  `tf.grad_pass_through(tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize_v2)(...)`.\n\n* Building TensorFlow:\n  * Windows platform builds: TensorFlow on Windows under MSVC is now built with\n  `--copt=/experimental:preprocessor --host_copt=/experimental:preprocessor`\n  (see `.bazelrc` for more details). Builds including TensorFlow may fail with\n  unexpected syntax errors if these flags are absent. See also\n  [this thread on SIG Build](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/g/build/c/LbAw8RILvTg/m/ttnuhYU2BgAJ).\n\n## Known Caveats\n  * `tf.keras.mixed_precision`\n    * When using mixed precision, calling `RMSprop.apply_gradients` or\n  `Nadam.apply_gradients` outside a `tf.function` does not work and will raise\n  the AttributeError \"Tensor.op is meaningless when eager execution is enabled\".\n  See this [issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/45536) for details and a workaround.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n### TF Core:\n  * Introduces experimental support for a new module named [`tf.experimental.numpy`]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/experimental/numpy), which is a\n  NumPy-compatible API for writing TF programs. This module provides class\n  `ndarray`, which mimics the `ndarray` class in NumPy, and wraps an immutable\n  `tf.Tensor` under the hood. A subset of NumPy functions (e.g. `numpy.add`) are\n  provided. Their inter-operation with TF facilities is seamless in most cases.\n    See [tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/ops/numpy_ops/README.md)\n    for details of what operations are supported and what are the differences\n  from NumPy.\n  * `tf.types.experimental.TensorLike` is a new `Union` type that can be used as\n  type annotation for variables representing a Tensor or a value\n    that can be converted to Tensor by `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\n  * Calling ops with a python constants or numpy values is now consistent with\n  tf.convert_to_tensor behavior. This avoids operations like\n    tf.reshape truncating inputs such as from int64 to int32.\n  * Adds `tf.sparse.map_values` to apply a function to the `.value`s of\n  `SparseTensor` arguments.\n  * The Python bitwise operators for `Tensor` (`__and__`, `__or__`, `__xor__` and `__invert__` now support non-`bool`\n  arguments and apply the corresponding bitwise ops. `bool` arguments continue\n  to be supported and dispatch to logical ops. This brings them more in line with\n  Python and NumPy behavior.\n  * Adds `tf.SparseTensor.with_values`. This returns a new SparseTensor with the same sparsity pattern, but with new provided values. It is\n    similar to the `with_values` function of `RaggedTensor`.\n  * Adds `StatelessCase` op, and uses it if none of case branches has stateful ops.\n  * Adds `tf.config.experimental.get_memory_usage` to return total memory usage of the device.\n  * Adds gradients for `RaggedTensorToVariant` and `RaggedTensorFromVariant`.\n  * Improve shape inference of nested function calls by supporting constant\n  folding across Arg nodes which makes more static values available to shape\n  inference functions.\n* `tf.debugging`:\n  * `tf.debugging.assert_shapes()` now works on `SparseTensor`s (Fixes [#36268](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/36268)).\n* GPU\n  * Adds Support for [TensorFloat-32](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/05/14/tensorfloat-32-precision-format/)\n  on Ampere based GPUs.TensorFloat-32, or TF32 for short, is a math mode for\n  NVIDIA Ampere based GPUs which causes certain float32 ops, such as matrix\n  multiplications and convolutions, to run much faster on Ampere GPUs but with\n  reduced precision. This reduced precision has not been found to effect\n  convergence quality of deep learning models in practice. TensorFloat-32 is\n  enabled by default, but can be disabled with `tf.config.experimental.enable_tensor_float_32_execution`.\n* `tf.math`:\n  * Adds `tf.math.erfcinv`, the inverse to `tf.math.erfc`.\n* `tf.nn`:\n  *   `tf.nn.max_pool2d` now supports explicit padding.\n* `tf.image`:\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.stateless_random_*` functions for each\n  `tf.image.random_*` function. Added a new op `stateless_sample_distorted_bounding_box`\n  which is a deterministic version of `sample_distorted_bounding_box` op.\n  Given the same seed, these stateless functions/ops produce the same results\n  independent of how many times the function is called, and independent of global seed settings.\n  * Adds deterministic `tf.image.resize` backprop CUDA kernels for\n  `method=ResizeMethod.BILINEAR` (the default method). Enable by setting the environment\n  variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to `\"true\"` or `\"1\"`.\n* `tf.print`:\n  * Bug fix in `tf.print()` with `OrderedDict` where if an `OrderedDict`\n  didn't have the keys sorted, the keys and values were not being printed\n    in accordance with their correct mapping.\n* `tf.train.Checkpoint`:\n  * Now accepts a `root` argument in the initialization, which generates a\n  checkpoint with a root object. This allows users to create a `Checkpoint`\n  object that     is compatible with Keras `model.save_weights()` and\n  `model.load_weights`. The checkpoint is also compatible with the checkpoint\n  saved in the `variables/` folder in the SavedModel.\n  * When restoring, `save_path` can be a path to a SavedModel. The function will\n  automatically find the checkpoint in the SavedModel.\n\n### `tf.data`:\n  * Adds new `tf.data.experimental.service.register_dataset` and\n  `tf.data.experimental.service.from_dataset_id` APIs to enable one process to\n  register a dataset with the tf.data service, and another process to consume\n  data from the dataset.\n  * Adds support for dispatcher fault tolerance. To enable fault tolerance,\n  configure a `work_dir` when running your dispatcher server and set\n  `dispatcher_fault_tolerance=True`. The dispatcher will store its state to\n  `work_dir`, so that on restart it can continue from its previous state after restart.\n  * Adds support for sharing dataset graphs via shared filesystem instead of\n  over RPC. This reduces load on the dispatcher, improving performance\n    of distributing datasets. For this to work, the dispatcher's `work_dir`\n  must be accessible from workers. If the worker fails to read from the `work_dir`,\n  it falls back to using RPC for dataset graph transfer.\n  * Adds support for a new \"distributed_epoch\" processing mode.\n  This processing mode distributes a dataset across all tf.data workers,\n    instead of having each worker process the full dataset. See\n  [the tf.data service docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service#understand_processing_mode)\n  to learn more.\n  * Adds optional `exclude_cols` parameter to CsvDataset. This parameter is the\n  complement of `select_cols`; at most one of these should be specified.\n  * We have implemented an optimization which reorders data-discarding\n  transformations such as `take` and `shard` to happen earlier in the dataset\n  when it is safe to do so. The optimization can be disabled via the\n  `experimental_optimization.reorder_data_discarding_ops` dataset option.\n  * `tf.data.Options` were previously immutable and can now be overridden.\n  * `tf.data.Dataset.from_generator` now supports Ragged and Sparse tensors with\n  a new `output_signature` argument, which allows `from_generator` to produce any\n  type describable by a `tf.TypeSpec`.\n  * `tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE` is now available in the core API as `tf.data.AUTOTUNE`.\n\n### `tf.distribute`:\n  * Introduces experimental support for asynchronous training of models via\n  `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`:\n    * Replaces the existing `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`\n  symbol with a new class that is for parameter server training in TF2. Usage of\n  the old symbol, usually with Estimator API, should be **replaced** with\n  [`tf.compat.v1.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`].\n    * Added `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.*` namespace, including the\n  main API `ClusterCoordinator` for coordinating the training cluster, the\n  related data structure `RemoteValue` and `PerWorkerValue`.\n  * `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy)\n  is now a stable API and is no longer considered experimental. Some of the major\n  improvements involve handling peer failure and many bug fixes. Please check out\n  the detailed tutorial on [Multi-worer training with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras).\n  * Adds `tf.distribute.Strategy.gather` and `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_gather`\n  APIs to support gathering dense distributed values.\n  * Fixes various issues with saving a distributed model.\n\n### `tf.keras`:\n  * Improvements from the Functional API refactoring:\n    * Functional model construction does not need to maintain a global workspace\n  graph, removing memory leaks especially when building many models or very large models.\n    * Functional model construction should be ~8-10% faster on average.\n    * Functional models can now contain non-symbolic values in their call inputs\n  inside of the first positional argument.\n    * Several classes of TF ops that were not reliably converted to Keras layers\n  during functional API construction should now work, e.g.`tf.image.ssim_multiscale`\n    * Error messages when Functional API construction goes wrong (and when ops cannot be converted to Keras layers automatically) should be\n      clearer and easier to understand.\n  * `Optimizer.minimize` can now accept a loss `Tensor` and a `GradientTape`\n  as an alternative to accepting a `callable` loss.\n  * Adds `beta` hyperparameter to [FTRL](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Ftrl)\n  optimizer classes (Keras and others) to match [FTRL paper](https://research.google.com/pubs/archive/41159.pdf).\n  * `Optimizer.__init__` now accepts a `gradient_aggregator` to allow for customization\n  of how gradients are aggregated across devices, as well as `gradients_transformers`\n  to allow for custom gradient transformations (such as gradient clipping).\n  * Improvements to Keras preprocessing layers:\n    * TextVectorization can now accept a vocabulary list or file as an init arg.\n    * Normalization can now accept mean and variance values as init args.\n  * In `Attention` and `AdditiveAttention` layers, the `call()` method now accepts a `return_attention_scores` argument. When set to\n    True, the layer returns the attention scores as an additional output argument.\n  * Adds `tf.metrics.log_cosh` and `tf.metrics.logcosh` API entrypoints with the\n  same implementation as their `tf.losses` equivalent.\n  * For Keras model, the individual call of `Model.evaluate` uses no cached data\n  for evaluation, while `Model.fit` uses cached data when `validation_data` arg\n  is provided for better performance.\n  * Adds a `save_traces` argument to `model.save`/ `tf.keras.models.save_model`\n  which determines whether the SavedModel format stores the Keras model/layer call\n  functions. The traced functions allow Keras to revive custom models and layers\n  without the original class definition, but if this isn't required the tracing\n  can be disabled with the added option.\n  * The `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API is now non-experimental.\n  The non-experimental API differs from the experimental API in several ways.\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.Policy` no longer takes in a `tf.mixed_precision.\n  experimental.LossScale` in the constructor, and no longer has a `LossScale`\n  associated with it. Instead, `Model.compile` will automatically wrap the optimizer\n  with a `LossScaleOptimizer` using dynamic loss scaling if `Policy.name`\n  is \"mixed_float16\".\n    * `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`'s constructor takes in different\n  arguments. In particular, it no longer takes in a `LossScale`, and there is\n  no longer a `LossScale` associated with the `LossScaleOptimizer`. Instead,\n  `LossScaleOptimizer` directly implements fixed or dynamic loss scaling. See the\n  documentation of [`tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer`]\n  (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/mixed_precision/experimental/LossScaleOptimizer?version=nightly)\n  for details on the differences between the experimental `LossScaleOptimizer`\n  and the new non-experimental `LossScaleOptimizer`.\n    * `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale` and its subclasses are\n  deprecated, as all of its functionality now exists within `tf.keras.mixed_precision.LossScaleOptimizer`\n\n### `tf.lite`:\n  * `TFLiteConverter`:\n    * Support optional flags `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type`\n  for full integer quantized models. This allows users to modify the model input\n  and output type to integer types (`tf.int8`, `tf.uint8`) instead of defaulting\n  to float type (`tf.float32`).\n  * NNAPI\n    * Adds NNAPI Delegation support for requantization use cases by converting\n  the operation into a dequantize-quantize pair.\n    * Removes deprecated `Interpreter.setUseNNAPI(boolean)` Java API. Use\n  `Interpreter.Options.setUseNNAPI` instead.\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::UseNNAPI(bool)` C++ API. Use `NnApiDelegate()`\n  and related delegate configuration methods directly.\n    * Deprecates `Interpreter::SetAllowFp16PrecisionForFp32(bool)` C++ API.\n  Prefer controlling this via delegate options, e.g. `tflite::StatefulNnApiDelegate::Options::allow_fp16'\n  or `TfLiteGpuDelegateOptionsV2::is_precision_loss_allowed`.\n  * GPU\n    * GPU acceleration now supports quantized models by default\n  * `DynamicBuffer::AddJoinedString()` will now add a separator if the first string to be joined is empty.\n  *  Adds support for cumulative sum (cumsum), both as builtin op and MLIR conversion.\n\n### `TensorRT`\n  * Issues a warning when the `session_config` parameter for the TF1 converter\n  is used or the `rewrite_config_template` field in the TF2 converter parameter\n  object is used.\n\n### TPU Enhancements:\n  * Adds support for the `beta` parameter of the FTRL optimizer for TPU\n  embeddings. Users of other TensorFlow platforms can implement equivalent\n  behavior by adjusting the `l2` parameter.\n\n### XLA Support:\n  * xla.experimental.compile is deprecated, use `tf.function(experimental_compile=True)` instead.\n  * Adds `tf.function.experimental_get_compiler_ir` which returns compiler IR\n  (currently 'hlo' and 'optimized_hlo') for given input for given function.\n\n### Security:\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior causing a segfault in `tf.raw_ops.Switch`,\n  ([CVE-2020-15190](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15190))\n  * Fixes three vulnerabilities in conversion to DLPack format\n    * [CVE-2020-15191](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15191),\n    * [CVE-2020-15192](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15192),\n    * [CVE-2020-15193](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15193)\n  * Fixes two vulnerabilities in `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad`\n    * [CVE-2020-15194](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15194),\n    * [CVE-2020-15195](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15195)\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in `RaggedCountSparseOutput` and `SparseCountSparseOutput` operations\n    * [CVE-2020-15196](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15196),\n    * [CVE-2020-15197](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15197),\n    * [CVE-2020-15198](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15198),\n    * [CVE-2020-15199](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15199),\n    * [CVE-2020-15200](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15200),\n    * [CVE-2020-15201](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15201)\n  * Fixes an integer truncation vulnerability in code using the work sharder API,\n  ([CVE-2020-15202](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15202))\n  * Fixes a format string vulnerability in `tf.strings.as_string`,\n  ([CVE-2020-15203](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15203))\n  * Fixes segfault raised by calling session-only ops in eager mode,\n  ([CVE-2020-15204](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15204))\n  * Fixes data leak and potential ASLR violation from `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`,\n  ([CVE-2020-15205](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15205))\n  * Fixes segfaults caused by incomplete `SavedModel` validation,\n  ([CVE-2020-15206](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15206))\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to a bug in negative indexing support in TFLite,\n  ([CVE-2020-15207](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15207))\n  * Fixes a data corruption due to dimension mismatch in TFLite,\n  ([CVE-2020-15208](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15208))\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite saved model format\n    * [CVE-2020-15209](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15209),\n    * [CVE-2020-15210](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15210),\n    * [CVE-2020-15211](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15211)\n  * Fixes several vulnerabilities in TFLite implementation of segment sum\n    * [CVE-2020-15212](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15212),\n    * [CVE-2020-15213](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15213),\n    * [CVE-2020-15214](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15214)\n  * Fixes a segfault in `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`,\n  ([CVE-2020-15265](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15265))\n  * Fixes an undefined behavior float cast causing a crash,\n  ([CVE-2020-15266](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15266))\n  * Fixes a lack of validation in `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatVecPermute` and\n  `tf.raw_ops.DataFormatDimMap` which can cause uninitialized memory access,\n  read outside bounds of arrays, data corruption and segmentation faults\n  ([CVE-2020-26267](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26267))\n  * Fixes a crash caused by writing to read only memory region\n  ([CVE-2020-26268](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26268))\n  * Fixes a heap out of bounds access in filesystem globbing implementation\n  ([CVE-2020-26269](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-26269))\n\n### Other:\n  * We have replaced uses of \"whitelist\" and \"blacklist\" with \"allowlist\" and\n  \"denylist\" where possible. Please see [this list](https://developers.google.com/style/word-list#blacklist) for more context.\n  * Adds `tf.config.experimental.mlir_bridge_rollout` which will help us rollout the new MLIR TPU bridge.\n  * Adds `tf.experimental.register_filesystem_plugin` to load modular filesystem plugins from Python\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google as well as the following external contributors:\n\n8bitmp3, aaa.jq, Abhineet Choudhary, Abolfazl Shahbazi, acxz, Adam Hillier, Adrian Garcia Badaracco, Ag Ramesh, ahmedsabie, Alan Anderson, Alexander Grund, Alexandre Lissy, Alexey Ivanov, Amedeo Cavallo, anencore94, Aniket Kumar Singh, Anthony Platanios, Ashwin Phadke, Balint Cristian, Basit Ayantunde, bbbboom, Ben Barsdell, Benjamin Chetioui, Benjamin Peterson, bhack, Bhanu Prakash Bandaru Venkata, Biagio Montaruli, Brent M.

[CVE-2020-13631](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13631),\n  [CVE-2020-13871](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-13871),\n  and\n  [CVE-2020-15358](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15358).\n* Fixes #41630 by including `max_seq_length` in CuDNN descriptor cache key\n* Pins `numpy` to 1.18.5 to prevent ABI breakage when compiling code that uses\n  both NumPy and TensorFlow headers.\n\n\n# Release 2.3.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n*   `tf.data` adds two new mechanisms to solve input pipeline bottlenecks and\n    save resources:\n\n    *   [snapshot](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/snapshot)\n    *   [tf.data service](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/experimental/service).\n\n    In addition checkout the detailed\n    [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data_performance_analysis) for\n    analyzing input pipeline performance with TF Profiler.\n\n*   [`tf.distribute.TPUStrategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/TPUStrategy)\n    is now a stable API and no longer considered experimental for TensorFlow.\n    (earlier `tf.distribute.experimental.TPUStrategy`).\n\n*   [TF Profiler](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) introduces two new\n    tools: a memory profiler to visualize your model\u2019s memory usage over time\n    and a [python tracer](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#events)\n    which allows you to trace python function calls in your model. Usability\n    improvements include better diagnostic messages and\n    [profile options](https://tensorflow.org/guide/profiler#collect_performance_data)\n    to customize the host and device trace verbosity level.\n\n*   Introduces experimental support for Keras Preprocessing Layers API\n    ([`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing.*`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/experimental/preprocessing?version=nightly))\n    to handle data preprocessing operations, with support for composite tensor\n    inputs. Please see below for additional details on these layers.\n\n*   TFLite now properly supports dynamic shapes during conversion and inference.\n    We\u2019ve also added opt-in support on Android and iOS for\n    [XNNPACK](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/xnnpack),\n    a highly optimized set of CPU kernels, as well as opt-in support for\n    [executing quantized models on the GPU](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/g3doc/performance/gpu_advanced.md#running-quantized-models-experimental).\n\n*   Libtensorflow packages are available in GCS starting this release. We have\n    also started to\n    [release a nightly version of these packages](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#official-builds).\n\n*   The experimental Python API\n    [`tf.debugging.experimental.enable_dump_debug_info()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/debugging/experimental/enable_dump_debug_info)\n    now allows you to instrument a TensorFlow program and dump debugging\n    information to a directory on the file system. The directory can be read and\n    visualized by a new interactive dashboard in TensorBoard 2.3 called\n    [Debugger V2](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/debugger_v2), which\n    reveals the details of the TensorFlow program including graph structures,\n    history of op executions at the Python (eager) and intra-graph levels, the\n    runtime dtype, shape, and numerical composition of tensors, as well as their\n    code locations.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n*   Increases the **minimum bazel version** required to build TF to **3.1.0**.\n*   `tf.data`\n    *   Makes the following (breaking) changes to the `tf.data`.\n    *   C++ API: - `IteratorBase::RestoreInternal`,\n        `IteratorBase::SaveInternal`, and `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState`\n        become pure-virtual and subclasses are now expected to provide an\n        implementation.\n    *   The deprecated `DatasetBase::IsStateful` method is removed in favor of\n        `DatasetBase::CheckExternalState`.\n    *   Deprecated overrides of `DatasetBase::MakeIterator` and\n        `MakeIteratorFromInputElement` are removed.\n    *   The signature of `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInternal` and\n        `tensorflow::data::IteratorBase::SaveInput` has been extended with\n        `SerializationContext` argument to enable overriding the default policy\n        for the handling external state during iterator checkpointing. This is\n        not a backwards compatible change and all subclasses of `IteratorBase`\n        *need to be updated* accordingly.\n*   `tf.keras`\n    *   Add a new `BackupAndRestore` callback for handling distributed training\n        failures & restarts. Please take a look at this\n        [tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/multi_worker_with_keras)\n        for details on how to use the callback.\n*   `tf.image.extract_glimpse` has been updated to correctly process the case\n    where `centered=False` and `normalized=False`. This is a breaking change as\n    the output is different from (incorrect) previous versions. Note this\n    breaking change only impacts `tf.image.extract_glimpse` and\n    `tf.compat.v2.image.extract_glimpse` API endpoints. The behavior of\n    `tf.compat.v1.image.extract_glimpse` does not change. The behavior of\n    existing C++ kernel `ExtractGlimpse` does not change either, so saved models\n    using `tf.raw_ops.ExtractGlimpse` will not be impacted.\n\n## Known Caveats\n  * `tf.lite`\n    * Keras-based LSTM models must be converted with an explicit batch size in the input layer.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n### TF Core:\n  * Set `tf2_behavior` to 1 to enable V2 for early loading cases.\n  * Add `execute_fn_for_device function` to dynamically choose the implementation based on underlying device placement.\n  * Eager:\n    * Add `reduce_logsumexp` benchmark with experiment compile.\n    * Give `EagerTensor`s a meaningful `__array__` implementation.\n    * Add another version of defun matmul for performance analysis.\n  * `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\n    * `AutoGraph` now includes into TensorFlow loops any variables that are closed over by local functions. Previously, such variables were sometimes incorrectly ignored.\n    * functions returned by the `get_concrete_function` method of `tf.function` objects can now be called with arguments consistent with the original arguments or type specs passed to `get_concrete_function`.  This calling convention is now the preferred way to use concrete functions with nested values and composite tensors. Please check the [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/concrete_function) for more details on `concrete_ function`.\n    * Update `tf.function`'s `experimental_relax_shapes` to handle composite tensors appropriately.\n    * Optimize `tf.function` invocation, by removing redundant list converter.\n    * `tf.function` will retrace when called with a different variable instead of simply using the `dtype` & `shape`.\n    * [Improve support](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33862) for dynamically-sized TensorArray inside `tf.function`.\n  * `tf.math`:\n    * Narrow down `argmin`/`argmax` contract to always return the smallest index for ties.\n    * `tf.math.reduce_variance` and `tf.math.reduce_std` return correct computation for complex types and no longer support integer types.\n    * Add Bessel functions of order 0,1 to `tf.math.special`.\n    * `tf.divide` now always returns a tensor to be consistent with documentation and other APIs.\n  * `tf.image`:\n    * Replaced [`tf.image.non_max_suppression_padded`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/image/non_max_suppression_padded?hl=en) with a new implementation that supports batched inputs, which is considerably faster on TPUs and GPUs. Boxes with area=0 will be ignored. Existing usage with single inputs should still work as before.\n  * `tf.linalg`\n    * Add `tf.linalg.banded_triangular_solve`.\n  * `tf.random`:\n    * Add `tf.random.stateless_parameterized_truncated_normal`.\n  * `tf.ragged`:\n    * Add `tf.ragged.cross` and `tf.ragged.cross_hashed` operations.\n  * `tf.RaggedTensor`:\n    * `RaggedTensor.to_tensor()` now preserves static shape.\n    * Add `tf.strings.format()` and `tf.print()` to support RaggedTensors.\n  * `tf.saved_model`:\n    * `@tf.function` from SavedModel no longer ignores args after a `RaggedTensor` when selecting the concrete function to run.\n    * Fix save model issue for ops with a list of functions.\n    * Add `tf.saved_model.LoadOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/LoadOptions?hl=en) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for loading models and weights.\n    * Update `tf.saved_model.SaveOptions` with [`experimental_io_device`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/saved_model/SaveOptions?hl=en) as arg with default value `None` to choose the I/O device for saving models and weights.\n    * Mutable tables now restore checkpointed values when loaded from SavedModel.\n    * The user object metadata field in the SavedModel proto has been deprecated as part of the updates to Keras SavedModel. Keras was the only consumer of this field prior to the update.\n  * GPU\n    * TF 2.3 includes PTX kernels only for [compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) 7.0 to reduce the TF pip binary size.  Earlier releases included PTX for a variety of older compute capabilities.\n    * Remove environmental variable `TF_USE_CUDNN`.\n  * Others\n    * Retain parent namescope for ops added inside `tf.while_loop`/`tf.cond`/`tf.switch_case`.\n    * Update `tf.vectorized_map` to support vectorizing `tf.while_loop` and TensorList operations.\n    * `tf.custom_gradient` can now be applied to functions that accept nested structures of `tensors` as inputs (instead of just a list of tensors). Note that Python structures such as tuples and lists now won't be treated as tensors, so if you still want them to be treated that way, you need to wrap them with `tf.convert_to_tensor`.\n    * No lowering on gradient case op when input is `DeviceIndex` op.\n    * Extend the ragged version of `tf.gather` to support `batch_dims` and `axis` args.\n    * Update `tf.map_fn` to support RaggedTensors and SparseTensors.\n    * Deprecate `tf.group`. It is not useful in eager mode.\n    * Add CPU and GPU implementation of modified variation of [`FTRL`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/ApplyFtrl)/[`FTRLV2`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/raw_ops/ApplyFtrlV2) that can triggerred by `multiply_linear_by_lr` allowing a learning rate of zero.\n\n### `tf.data`:\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` works correctly with tuples.\n  * `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch` to output variable ragged rank.\n  * `tf.data.experimental.cardinality` is now a method on `tf.data.Dataset`.\n  * `tf.data.Dataset` now supports `len(Dataset)` when the cardinality is finite.\n\n### `tf.distribute`:\n  * Expose experimental [`tf.distribute.DistributedDataset`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedDataset?hl=en) and [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator) to distribute input data when using `tf.distribute` to scale training on multiple devices.\n    * Added a [`get_next_as_optional`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator?hl=en#get_next_as_optional) method for [`tf.distribute.DistributedIterator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/DistributedIterator?hl=en) class to return a `tf.experimental.Optional` instance that contains the next value for all replicas or none instead of raising an out of range error. Also see *new* [guide on input distribution](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input).\n  * Allow var.assign on MirroredVariables with aggregation=NONE in replica context. Previously this would raise an error. We now allow this because many users and library writers find using `.assign` in replica context to be more convenient, instead of having to use `Strategy.extended.update` which was the previous way of updating variables in this situation.\n  * `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` adds support for partial batches. Workers running out of data now continue to participate in the training with empty inputs, instead of raising an error. Learn more about [partial batches here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/distribute/input#partial_batches).\n  * Improve the performance of reading metrics eagerly under `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\n  * Fix the issue that `strategy.reduce()` inside `tf.function` may raise exceptions when the values to reduce are from loops or if-clauses.\n  * Fix the issue that `tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy` cannot be used together with `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\n  * Add a `tf.distribute.cluster_resolver.TPUClusterResolver.connect` API to simplify TPU initialization.\n  * Add `tf.distribute.Strategy.gather` and `tf.distribute.ReplicaContext.all_gather` methods to gather and concatenate `tf.distribute.DistributedValues` across workers and devices.\n\n### `tf.keras`:\n  * Introduces experimental preprocessing layers API (`tf.keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing`)  to handle data preprocessing operations such as categorical feature encoding, text vectorization, data normalization, and data discretization (binning). The newly added layers provide a replacement for the  legacy feature column API, and support composite tensor inputs.\n  * Added **categorical data** processing layers:\n    * `IntegerLookup` & `StringLookup`: build an index of categorical feature values\n    * `CategoryEncoding`: turn integer-encoded categories into one-hot, multi-hot, or tf-idf encoded representations\n    * `CategoryCrossing`: create new categorical features representing co-occurrences of previous categorical feature values\n    * `Hashing`: the hashing trick, for large-vocabulary categorical features\n    * `Discretization`: turn continuous numerical features into categorical features by binning their values\n  * Improved **image preprocessing** layers: `CenterCrop`, `Rescaling`\n  * Improved **image augmentation** layers: `RandomCrop`, `RandomFlip`, `RandomTranslation`, `RandomRotation`, `RandomHeight`, `RandomWidth`, `RandomZoom`, `RandomContrast`\n  * Improved **`TextVectorization`** layer, which handles string tokenization, n-gram generation, and token encoding\n    * The `TextVectorization` layer now accounts for the mask_token as part of the vocabulary size when output_mode='int'. This means that, if you have a max_tokens value of 5000, your output will have 5000 unique values (not 5001 as before).\n    * Change the return value of `TextVectorization.get_vocabulary()` from `byte` to `string`. Users who previously were calling 'decode' on the output of this method should no longer need to do so.\n  * Introduce new Keras dataset generation utilities :\n    * **[`image_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/image_dataset_from_directory)** is a utility based on `tf.data.Dataset`, meant to replace the legacy `ImageDataGenerator`. It takes you from a structured directory of images to a labeled dataset, in one function call. Note that it doesn't perform image data augmentation (which is meant to be done using preprocessing layers).\n    * **[`text_dataset_from_directory`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/text_dataset_from_directory)** takes you from a structured directory of text files to a labeled dataset, in one function call.\n    * **[`timeseries_dataset_from_array`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/preprocessing/timeseries_dataset_from_array)** is a `tf.data.Dataset`-based replacement of the legacy `TimeseriesGenerator`. It takes you from an array of timeseries data to a dataset of shifting windows with their targets.\n  * Added [`experimental_steps_per_execution`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model?hl=en#compile)\n arg to `model.compile` to indicate the number of batches to run per `tf.function` call. This can speed up Keras Models on TPUs up to 3x.\n  * Extends `tf.keras.layers.Lambda` layers to support multi-argument lambdas, and keyword arguments when calling the layer.\n  * Functional models now get constructed if *any* tensor in a layer call's arguments/keyword arguments comes from a keras input. Previously the functional api would only work if all of the elements in the first argument to the layer came from a keras input.\n  * Clean up `BatchNormalization` layer's `trainable` property to act like standard python state when it's used inside `tf.functions` (frozen at tracing time), instead of acting like a pseudo-variable whose updates *kind of sometimes* get reflected in already-traced `tf.function` traces.\n  * Add the `Conv1DTranspose` layer.\n  * Refine the semantics of `SensitivitySpecificityBase` derived metrics. See the updated API docstrings for [`tf.keras.metrics.SensitivityAtSpecificity`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/SensitivityAtSpecificity) and [`tf.keras.metrics.SpecificityAtSensitivty`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.3/api_docs/python/tf/keras/metrics/SpecificityAtSensitivity).\n\n### `tf.lite`:\n  * Converter\n      * Restored `inference_input_type` and `inference_output_type` flags in TF 2.x TFLiteConverter (backward compatible with TF 1.x) to support integer (tf.int8, tf.uint8) input and output types in post training full integer quantized models.\n      * Added support for converting and resizing models with dynamic (placeholder) dimensions. Previously, there was only limited support for dynamic batch size, and even that did not guarantee that the model could be properly resized at runtime.\n       * Enabled experimental support for a new quantization mode with 16-bit activations and 8-bit weights. See `lite.OpsSet.EXPERIMENTAL_TFLITE_BUILTINS_ACTIVATIONS_INT16_WEIGHTS_INT8`.\n  * CPU\n      * Fix an issue w/ dynamic weights and `Conv2D` on x86.\n      * Add a runtime Android flag for enabling `XNNPACK` for optimized CPU performance.\n      * Add a runtime iOS flag for enabling `XNNPACK` for optimized CPU performance.\n      * Add a compiler flag to enable building a TFLite library that applies `XNNPACK` delegate automatically when the model has a `fp32` operation.\n  * GPU\n      * Allow GPU acceleration starting with internal graph nodes\n      * Experimental support for quantized models with the Android GPU delegate\n      * Add GPU delegate whitelist.\n      * Rename GPU whitelist -> compatibility (list).\n      * Improve GPU compatibility list entries from crash reports.\n  * NNAPI\n      * Set default value for `StatefulNnApiDelegate::Options::max_number_delegated_partitions` to 3.\n      * Add capability to disable `NNAPI` CPU and check `NNAPI` Errno.\n      * Fix crashes when using `NNAPI` with target accelerator specified with model containing Conv2d or FullyConnected or LSTM nodes with quantized weights.\n      * Fix `ANEURALNETWORKS_BAD_DATA` execution failures with `sum`/`max`/`min`/`reduce` operations with `scalar` inputs.\n  * Hexagon\n      * TFLite Hexagon Delegate out of experimental.\n      * Experimental `int8` support for most hexagon ops.\n      * Experimental per-channel quant support for `conv` in Hexagon delegate.\n      * Support dynamic batch size in C++ API.\n  * CoreML\n     * Opensource CoreML delegate\n  * Misc\n      * Enable building Android TFLite targets on Windows\n      * Add support for `BatchMatMul`.\n      * Add support for `half_pixel_centers` with `ResizeNearestNeighbor`.\n      * Add 3D support for `BatchToSpaceND`.\n      * Add 5D support for `BroadcastSub`, `Maximum`, `Minimum`, `Transpose` and `BroadcastDiv`.\n      * Rename `kTfLiteActRelu1` to `kTfLiteActReluN1To1`.\n      * Enable flex delegate on tensorflow.lite.Interpreter Python package.\n      * Add `Buckettize`, `SparseCross` and `BoostedTreesBucketize` to the flex whitelist.\n      * Add support for selective registration of flex ops.\n      * Add missing kernels for flex delegate whitelisted ops.\n      * Fix issue when using direct `ByteBuffer` inputs with graphs that have dynamic shapes.\n      * Fix error checking supported operations in a model containing `HardSwish`.\n\n### Packaging Support\n  * Added `tf.sysconfig.get_build_info()`. Returns a dict that describes the build environment of the currently installed TensorFlow package, e.g. the NVIDIA CUDA and NVIDIA CuDNN versions used when TensorFlow was built.\n\n### Profiler\n  * Fix a subtle use-after-free issue in `XStatVisitor::RefValue()`.\n\n### TPU Enhancements\n  * Adds 3D mesh support in TPU configurations ops.\n  * Added TPU code for `FTRL` with `multiply_linear_by_lr`.\n  * Silently adds a new file system registry at `gstpu`.\n  * Support `restartType` in cloud tpu client.\n  * Depend on a specific version of google-api-python-client.\n  * Fixes apiclient import.\n\n### Tracing and Debugging\n  * Add a `TFE_Py_Execute` traceme.\n\n### XLA Support\n  * Implement stable `argmin` and `argmax`\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n902449@58880@bigcat_chen@ASIC, Abdul Baseer Khan, Abhineet Choudhary, Abolfazl Shahbazi, Adam Hillier, ag.ramesh, Agoniii, Ajay P, Alex Hoffman, Alexander Bayandin, Alexander Grund, Alexandre Abadie, Alexey Rogachevskiy, amoitra, Andrew Stevens, Angus-Luo, Anshuman Tripathy, Anush Elangovan, Artem Mavrin, Ashutosh Hathidara, autoih, Ayushman Kumar, ayushmankumar7, Bairen Yi, Bas Aarts, Bastian Eichenberger, Ben Barsdell, bhack, Bharat Raghunathan, Biagio Montaruli, Bigcat-Himax, blueyi, Bryan Cutler, Byambaa, Carlos Hernandez-Vaquero, Chen Lei, Chris Knorowski, Christian Clauss, chuanqiw, CuiYifeng, Daniel Situnayake, Daria Zhuravleva, Dayananda-V, Deven Desai, Devi Sandeep Endluri, Dmitry Zakharov, Dominic Jack, Duncan Riach, Edgar Liberis, Ehsan Toosi, ekuznetsov139, Elena Zhelezina, Eugene Kuznetsov, Eugene Mikhantiev, Evgenii Zheltonozhskii, Fabio Di Domenico, Fausto Morales, Fei Sun, feihugis, Felix E.

Because all images now use Python 3, Docker tags containing `-py3` will no longer be provided and existing `-py3` tags like `latest-py3` will not be updated.\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* Replaced the scalar type for string tensors from `std::string` to `tensorflow::tstring` which is now ABI stable.\n* A new Profiler for TF 2 for CPU/GPU/TPU. It offers both device and host performance analysis, including input pipeline and TF Ops. Optimization advisory is provided whenever possible. Please see [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_profiling_keras) and [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/profiler) for usage guidelines.\n* Export C++ functions to Python using `pybind11` as opposed to `SWIG` as a part of our [deprecation of swig efforts](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20190208-pybind11.md).\n* `tf.distribute`:\n  * Support added for global sync `BatchNormalization` by using the newly added `tf.keras.layers.experimental.SyncBatchNormalization` layer. This layer will sync `BatchNormalization` statistics every step across all replicas taking part in sync training.\n  * Performance improvements for GPU multi-worker distributed training using `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`\n    * Update NVIDIA `NCCL` to `2.5.7-1` for better performance and performance tuning. Please see [nccl developer guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-developer-guide/docs/env.html) for more information on this.\n    * Support gradient `allreduce` in `float16`. See this [example](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/modeling/grad_utils.py) usage.\n    * Experimental support of [all reduce gradient packing](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/distribute/experimental/CollectiveHints) to allow overlapping gradient aggregation with backward path computation.\n    * Deprecated `experimental_run_v2` method for distribution strategies and renamed the method `run` as it is no longer experimental.\n    * Add CompositeTensor support for DistributedIterators. This should help prevent unnecessary function retracing and memory leaks.\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * `Model.fit` major improvements:\n     * You can now use custom training logic with `Model.fit` by overriding `Model.train_step`.\n     * Easily write state-of-the-art training loops without worrying about all of the features `Model.fit` handles for you (distribution strategies, callbacks, data formats, looping logic, etc)\n     * See the default [`Model.train_step`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1381fc8e15e22402417b98e3881dfd409998daea/tensorflow/python/keras/engine/training.py#L540) for an example of what this function should look like. Same applies for validation and inference via `Model.test_step` and `Model.predict_step`.\n     * SavedModel uses its own `Model._saved_model_inputs_spec` attr now instead of\n       relying on `Model.inputs` and `Model.input_names`, which are no longer set for subclass Models.\n       This attr is set in eager, `tf.function`, and graph modes. This gets rid of the need for users to\n       manually call `Model._set_inputs` when using Custom Training Loops(CTLs).\n     * Dynamic shapes are supported for generators by calling the Model on the first batch we \"peek\" from the generator.\n       This used to happen implicitly in `Model._standardize_user_data`. Long-term, a solution where the\n       `DataAdapter` doesn't need to call the Model is probably preferable.\n  * The SavedModel format now supports all Keras built-in layers (including metrics, preprocessing layers, and stateful RNN layers)\n  * Update Keras batch normalization layer to use the running mean and average computation in the `fused_batch_norm`. You should see significant performance improvements when using `fused_batch_norm` in Eager mode.\n\n* `tf.lite`:\n  * Enable TFLite experimental new converter by default.\n* XLA\n  * XLA now builds and works on windows. All prebuilt packages come with XLA available.\n  * XLA can be [enabled for a `tf.function`](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla#explicit_compilation_with_tffunction\n) with \u201ccompile or throw exception\u201d semantics on CPU and GPU.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * In `tf.keras.applications` the name of the \"top\" layer has been standardized to \"predictions\". This is only a problem if your code relies on the exact name of the layer.\n  * Huber loss function has been updated to be consistent with other Keras losses. It now computes mean over the last axis of per-sample losses before applying the reduction function.\n* AutoGraph no longer converts functions passed to `tf.py_function`, `tf.py_func` and `tf.numpy_function`.\n* Deprecating `XLA_CPU` and `XLA_GPU` devices with this release.\n* Increasing the minimum bazel version to build TF to 2.0.0 to use Bazel's `cc_experimental_shared_library`.\n* Keras compile/fit behavior for functional and subclassed models have been unified. Model properties such as `metrics`, `metrics_names` will now be available only after **training/evaluating the model on actual data** for functional models. `metrics` will **now include** model `loss` and output losses.`loss_functions` property has been removed from the model. This was an undocumented property that was accidentally public and has now been removed.\n\n## Known Caveats\n* The current TensorFlow release now **requires** [gast](https://pypi.org/project/gast/) version 0.3.3.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   `tf.data`:\n    *   Removed `autotune_algorithm` from experimental optimization options.\n*   TF Core:\n    *   `tf.constant` always creates CPU tensors irrespective of the current\n        device context.\n    *   Eager `TensorHandles` maintain a list of mirrors for any copies to local\n        or remote devices. This avoids any redundant copies due to op execution.\n    *   For `tf.Tensor` & `tf.Variable`, `.experimental_ref()` is no longer\n        experimental and is available as simply `.ref()`.\n    *   `pfor/vectorized_map`: Added support for vectorizing 56 more ops.\n        Vectorizing `tf.cond` is also supported now.\n    *   Set as much partial shape as we can infer statically within the gradient\n        impl of the gather op.\n    *   Gradient of `tf.while_loop` emits `StatelessWhile` op if `cond` and body\n        functions are stateless. This allows multiple gradients while ops to run\n        in parallel under distribution strategy.\n    *   Speed up `GradientTape` in eager mode by auto-generating list of op\n        inputs/outputs which are unused and hence not cached for gradient\n        functions.\n    *   Support `back_prop=False` in `while_v2` but mark it as deprecated.\n    *   Improve error message when attempting to use `None` in data-dependent\n        control flow.\n    *   Add `RaggedTensor.numpy()`.\n    *   Update `RaggedTensor.__getitem__` to preserve uniform dimensions & allow\n        indexing into uniform dimensions.\n    *   Update `tf.expand_dims` to always insert the new dimension as a\n        non-ragged dimension.\n    *   Update `tf.embedding_lookup` to use `partition_strategy` and `max_norm`\n        when `ids` is ragged.\n    *   Allow `batch_dims==rank(indices)` in `tf.gather`.\n    *   Add support for bfloat16 in `tf.print`.\n*   `tf.distribute`:\n    *   Support `embedding_column` with variable-length input features for\n        `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\n*   `tf.keras`:\n    *   Added `experimental_aggregate_gradients` argument to\n        `tf.keras.optimizer.Optimizer.apply_gradients`. This allows custom\n        gradient aggregation and processing aggregated gradients in custom\n        training loop.\n    *   Allow `pathlib.Path` paths for loading models via Keras API.\n*   `tf.function`/AutoGraph:\n    *   AutoGraph is now available in `ReplicaContext.merge_call`,\n        `Strategy.extended.update` and `Strategy.extended.update_non_slot`.\n    *   Experimental support for shape invariants has been enabled in\n        `tf.function`. See the API docs for\n        `tf.autograph.experimental.set_loop_options` for additional info.\n    *   AutoGraph error messages now exclude frames corresponding to APIs\n        internal to AutoGraph.\n    *   Improve shape inference for `tf.function` input arguments to unlock more\n        Grappler optimizations in TensorFlow 2.x.\n    *   Improve automatic control dependency management of resources by allowing\n        resource reads to occur in parallel and synchronizing only on writes.\n    *   Fix execution order of multiple stateful calls to `experimental_run_v2`\n        in `tf.function`.\n    *   You can now iterate over `RaggedTensors` using a for loop inside\n        `tf.function`.\n*   `tf.lite`:\n    *   Migrated the `tf.lite` C inference API out of experimental into lite/c.\n    *   Add an option to disallow `NNAPI` CPU / partial acceleration on Android\n        10\n    *   TFLite Android AARs now include the C headers and APIs are required to\n        use TFLite from native code.\n    *   Refactors the delegate and delegate kernel sources to allow usage in the\n        linter.\n    *   Limit delegated ops to actually supported ones if a device name is\n        specified or `NNAPI` CPU Fallback is disabled.\n    *   TFLite now supports `tf.math.reciprocal1` op by lowering to `tf.div op`.\n    *   TFLite's unpack op now supports boolean tensor inputs.\n    *   Microcontroller and embedded code moved from experimental to main\n        TensorFlow Lite folder\n    *   Check for large TFLite tensors.\n    *   Fix GPU delegate crash with C++17.\n    *   Add 5D support to TFLite `strided_slice`.\n    *   Fix error in delegation of `DEPTH_TO_SPACE` to `NNAPI` causing op not to\n        be accelerated.\n    *   Fix segmentation fault when running a model with LSTM nodes using\n        `NNAPI` Delegate\n    *   Fix `NNAPI` delegate failure when an operand for Maximum/Minimum\n        operation is a scalar.\n    *   Fix `NNAPI` delegate failure when Axis input for reduce operation is a\n        scalar.\n    *   Expose option to limit the number of partitions that will be delegated\n        to `NNAPI`.\n    *   If a target accelerator is specified, use its feature level to determine\n        operations to delegate instead of SDK version.\n*   `tf.random`:\n    *   Various random number generation improvements:\n    *   Add a fast path for default `random_uniform`\n    *   `random_seed` documentation improvement.\n    *   `RandomBinomial` broadcasts and appends the sample shape to the left\n        rather than the right.\n    *   Added `tf.random.stateless_binomial`, `tf.random.stateless_gamma`,\n        `tf.random.stateless_poisson`\n    *   `tf.random.stateless_uniform` now supports unbounded sampling of `int`\n        types.\n*   Math and Linear Algebra:\n    *   Add `tf.linalg.LinearOperatorTridiag`.\n    *   Add `LinearOperatorBlockLowerTriangular`\n    *   Add broadcasting support to\n        tf.linalg.triangular_solve[#26204](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/26204),\n        tf.math.invert_permutation.\n    *   Add `tf.math.sobol_sample` op.\n    *   Add `tf.math.xlog1py`.\n    *   Add `tf.math.special.{dawsn,expi,fresnel_cos,fresnel_sin,spence}`.\n    *   Add a Modified Discrete Cosine Transform (MDCT) and its inverse to\n        `tf.signal`.\n*   TPU Enhancements:\n    *   Refactor `TpuClusterResolver` to move shared logic to a separate pip\n        package.\n    *   Support configuring TPU software version from cloud tpu client.\n    *   Allowed TPU embedding weight decay factor to be multiplied by learning\n        rate.\n*   XLA Support:\n    *   Add standalone XLA AOT runtime target + relevant .cc sources to pip\n        package.\n    *   Add check for memory alignment to MemoryAllocation::MemoryAllocation()\n        on 32-bit ARM. This ensures a deterministic early exit instead of a hard\n        to debug bus error later.\n    *   `saved_model_cli aot_compile_cpu` allows you to compile saved models to\n        XLA header+object files and include them in your C++ programs.\n    *   Enable `Igamma`, `Igammac` for XLA.\n*   Deterministic Op Functionality:\n    *   XLA reduction emitter is deterministic when the environment variable\n        `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` is set to \"true\" or \"1\". This extends\n        deterministic `tf.nn.bias_add` back-prop functionality (and therefore\n        also deterministic back-prop of bias-addition in Keras layers) to\n        include when XLA JIT compilation is enabled.\n    *   Fix problem, when running on a CUDA GPU and when either environment\n        variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` or environment variable\n        `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC` is set to \"true\" or \"1\", in which some layer\n        configurations led to an exception with the message \"No algorithm\n        worked!\"\n*   Tracing and Debugging:\n    *   Add source, destination name to `_send` traceme to allow easier\n        debugging.\n    *   Add traceme event to `fastpathexecute`.\n*   Other:\n    *   Fix an issue with AUC.reset_states for multi-label AUC\n        [#35852](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/35852)\n    *   Fix the TF upgrade script to not delete files when there is a parsing\n        error and the output mode is `in-place`.\n    *   Move `tensorflow/core:framework/*_pyclif` rules to\n        `tensorflow/core/framework:*_pyclif`.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n372046933, 8bitmp3, aaronhma, Abin Shahab, Aditya Patwardhan, Agoniii, Ahti Kitsik, Alan Yee, Albin Joy, Alex Hoffman, Alexander Grund, Alexandre E.

Python 2 support [officially ends an January 1, 2020](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update). [As announced earlier](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/d/msg/announce/gVwS5RC8mds/dCt1ka2XAAAJ), TensorFlow will also stop supporting Python 2 starting January 1, 2020, and no more releases are expected in 2019.\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n*   The `tensorflow` pip package now includes GPU support by default (same as\n    `tensorflow-gpu`) for both Linux and Windows. This runs on machines with and\n    without NVIDIA GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` is still available, and CPU-only\n    packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned\n    about package size.\n*   **Windows users:** Officially-released `tensorflow` Pip packages are now\n    built with Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4 in order to take advantage of the\n    new `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions` compiler flag. To use these new\n    packages, you must install \"Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual\n    Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019\", available from Microsoft's website\n    [here](https://support.microsoft.com/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads).\n    *   This does not change the minimum required version for building\n        TensorFlow from source on Windows, but builds enabling\n        `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` can take over 48 hours to compile without this\n        flag. Refer to `configure.py` for more information about\n        `EIGEN_STRONG_INLINE` and `/d2ReducedOptimizeHugeFunctions`.\n    *   If either of the required DLLs, `msvcp140.dll` (old) or `msvcp140_1.dll`\n        (new), are missing on your machine, `import tensorflow` will print a\n        warning message.\n*   The `tensorflow` pip package is built with CUDA 10.1 and cuDNN 7.6.\n*   `tf.keras`\n    *   Experimental support for mixed precision is available on GPUs and Cloud\n        TPUs. See\n        [usage guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/mixed_precision).\n    *   Introduced the `TextVectorization` layer, which takes as input raw\n        strings and takes care of text standardization, tokenization, n-gram\n        generation, and vocabulary indexing. See this\n        [end-to-end text classification example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RvCnR7h0_l4Ekn5vINWToI9TNJdpUZB3).\n    *   Keras `.compile` `.fit` `.evaluate` and `.predict` are allowed to be\n        outside of the DistributionStrategy scope, as long as the model was\n        constructed inside of a scope.\n    *   Experimental support for Keras `.compile`, `.fit`, `.evaluate`, and\n        `.predict` is available for Cloud TPUs, Cloud TPU, for all types of\n        Keras models (sequential, functional and subclassing models).\n    *   Automatic outside compilation is now enabled for Cloud TPUs. This allows\n        `tf.summary` to be used more conveniently with Cloud TPUs.\n    *   Dynamic batch sizes with DistributionStrategy and Keras are supported on\n        Cloud TPUs.\n    *   Support for `.fit`, `.evaluate`, `.predict` on TPU using numpy data, in\n        addition to `tf.data.Dataset`.\n    *   Keras reference implementations for many popular models are available in\n        the TensorFlow\n        [Model Garden](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official).\n*   `tf.data`\n    *   Changes rebatching for `tf.data datasets` + DistributionStrategy for\n        better performance. Note that the dataset also behaves slightly\n        differently, in that the rebatched dataset cardinality will always be a\n        multiple of the number of replicas.\n    *   `tf.data.Dataset` now supports automatic data distribution and sharding\n        in distributed environments, including on TPU pods.\n    *   Distribution policies for `tf.data.Dataset` can now be tuned with 1.\n        `tf.data.experimental.AutoShardPolicy(OFF, AUTO, FILE, DATA)` 2.\n        `tf.data.experimental.ExternalStatePolicy(WARN, IGNORE, FAIL)`\n*   `tf.debugging`\n    *   Add `tf.debugging.enable_check_numerics()` and\n        `tf.debugging.disable_check_numerics()` to help debugging the root\n        causes of issues involving infinities and `NaN`s.\n*   `tf.distribute`\n    *   Custom training loop support on TPUs and TPU pods is available through\n        `strategy.experimental_distribute_dataset`,\n        `strategy.experimental_distribute_datasets_from_function`,\n        `strategy.experimental_run_v2`, `strategy.reduce`.\n    *   Support for a global distribution strategy through\n        `tf.distribute.experimental_set_strategy(),` in addition to\n        `strategy.scope()`.\n*   `TensorRT`\n    *   [TensorRT 6.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt#tensorrt-whats-new)\n        is now supported and enabled by default. This adds support for more\n        TensorFlow ops including Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInputV2, AvgPool3D,\n        MaxPool3D, ResizeBilinear, and ResizeNearestNeighbor. In addition, the\n        TensorFlow-TensorRT python conversion API is exported as\n        `tf.experimental.tensorrt.Converter`.\n*   Environment variable `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` has been added. When set to\n    \"true\" or \"1\", this environment variable makes `tf.nn.bias_add` operate\n    deterministically (i.e. reproducibly), but currently only when XLA JIT\n    compilation is *not* enabled. Setting `TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS` to \"true\" or\n    \"1\" also makes cuDNN convolution and max-pooling operate deterministically.\n    This makes Keras Conv\\*D and MaxPool\\*D layers operate deterministically in\n    both the forward and backward directions when running on a CUDA-enabled GPU.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n* Deletes `Operation.traceback_with_start_lines` for which we know of no usages.\n* Removed `id` from `tf.Tensor.__repr__()` as `id` is not useful other than internal debugging.\n* Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the `session.run()`. This only changes behavior when the graph execution would have resulted in an error. When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\n* The following APIs are not longer experimental: `tf.config.list_logical_devices`, `tf.config.list_physical_devices`, `tf.config.get_visible_devices`, `tf.config.set_visible_devices`, `tf.config.get_logical_device_configuration`, `tf.config.set_logical_device_configuration`.\n* `tf.config.experimentalVirtualDeviceConfiguration` has been renamed to `tf.config.LogicalDeviceConfiguration`.\n* `tf.config.experimental_list_devices` has been removed, please use\n`tf.config.list_logical_devices`.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* `tf.data`\n  * Fixes concurrency issue with `tf.data.experimental.parallel_interleave` with `sloppy=True`.\n  * Add `tf.data.experimental.dense_to_ragged_batch()`.\n  * Extend `tf.data` parsing ops to support `RaggedTensors`.\n* `tf.distribute`\n  * Fix issue where GRU would crash or give incorrect output when a `tf.distribute.Strategy` was used.\n* `tf.estimator`\n  * Added option in `tf.estimator.CheckpointSaverHook` to not save the `GraphDef`.\n  * Moving the checkpoint reader from swig to pybind11.\n* `tf.keras`\n  * Export `depthwise_conv2d` in `tf.keras.backend`.\n  * In Keras Layers and Models, Variables in `trainable_weights`, `non_trainable_weights`, and `weights` are explicitly deduplicated.\n  * Keras `model.load_weights` now accepts `skip_mismatch` as an argument. This was available in external Keras, and has now been copied over to `tf.keras`.\n  * Fix the input shape caching behavior of Keras convolutional layers.\n  * `Model.fit_generator`, `Model.evaluate_generator`, `Model.predict_generator`, `Model.train_on_batch`, `Model.test_on_batch`, and `Model.predict_on_batch` methods now respect the `run_eagerly` property, and will correctly run using `tf.function` by default. Note that `Model.fit_generator`, `Model.evaluate_generator`, and `Model.predict_generator` are deprecated endpoints. They are subsumed by `Model.fit`, `Model.evaluate`, and `Model.predict` which now support generators and Sequences.\n* `tf.lite`\n  * Legalization for `NMS` ops in TFLite.\n  * add `narrow_range` and `axis` to `quantize_v2` and `dequantize` ops.\n  * Added support for `FusedBatchNormV3` in converter.\n  * Add an `errno`-like field to `NNAPI` delegate for detecting `NNAPI` errors for fallback behaviour.\n  * Refactors `NNAPI` Delegate to support detailed reason why an operation is not accelerated.\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\n* Other\n  * Critical stability updates for TPUs, especially in cases where the XLA compiler produces compilation errors.\n  * TPUs can now be re-initialized multiple times, using `tf.tpu.experimental.initialize_tpu_system`.\n  * Add `RaggedTensor.merge_dims()`.\n  * Added new `uniform_row_length` row-partitioning tensor to `RaggedTensor`.\n  * Add `shape` arg to `RaggedTensor.to_tensor`; Improve speed of `RaggedTensor.to_tensor`.\n  * `tf.io.parse_sequence_example` and `tf.io.parse_single_sequence_example` now support ragged features.\n  * Fix `while_v2` with variables in custom gradient.\n  * Support taking gradients of V2 `tf.cond` and `tf.while_loop` using `LookupTable`.\n  * Fix bug where `vectorized_map` failed on inputs with unknown static shape.\n  * Add preliminary support for sparse CSR matrices.\n  * Tensor equality with `None` now behaves as expected.\n  * Make calls to `tf.function(f)()`, `tf.function(f).get_concrete_function` and `tf.function(f).get_initialization_function` thread-safe.\n  * Extend `tf.identity` to work with CompositeTensors (such as SparseTensor)\n  * Added more `dtypes` and zero-sized inputs to `Einsum` Op and improved its performance\n  * Enable multi-worker `NCCL` `all-reduce` inside functions executing eagerly.\n  * Added complex128 support to `RFFT`, `RFFT2D`, `RFFT3D`, `IRFFT`, `IRFFT2D`, and `IRFFT3D`.\n  * Add `pfor` converter for `SelfAdjointEigV2`.\n  * Add `tf.math.ndtri` and `tf.math.erfinv`.\n  * Add `tf.config.experimental.enable_mlir_bridge` to allow using MLIR compiler bridge in eager model.\n  * Added support for MatrixSolve on Cloud TPU / XLA.\n  * Added `tf.autodiff.ForwardAccumulator` for forward-mode autodiff\n  * Add `LinearOperatorPermutation`.\n  * A few performance optimizations on `tf.reduce_logsumexp`.\n  * Added multilabel handling to `AUC` metric\n  * Optimization on `zeros_like`.\n  * Dimension constructor now requires `None` or types with an `__index__` method.\n  * Add `tf.random.uniform` microbenchmark.\n  * Use `_protogen` suffix for proto library targets instead of `_cc_protogen` suffix.\n  * Moving the checkpoint reader from `swig` to `pybind11`.\n  * `tf.device` & `MirroredStrategy` now supports passing in a `tf.config.LogicalDevice`\n  * If you're building Tensorflow from source, consider using [bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) to automatically download and use the correct Bazel version. Bazelisk reads the `.bazelversion` file at the root of the project directory.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n8bitmp3, Aaron Ma, Abd\u00fcLhamit Yilmaz, Abhai Kollara, aflc, Ag Ramesh, Albert Z.

We do not expect to update the 1.x branch with features, although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year.\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n* As [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!topic/developers/iRCt5m4qUz0), `tensorflow` pip package will by default include GPU support (same as `tensorflow-gpu` now) for the platforms we currently have GPU support (Linux and Windows). It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs. `tensorflow-gpu` will still be available, and CPU-only packages can be downloaded at `tensorflow-cpu` for users who are concerned about package size.\n* TensorFlow 1.15 contains a complete implementation of the 2.0 API in its `compat.v2` module. It contains a copy of the 1.15 main module (without `contrib`) in the `compat.v1` module. TensorFlow 1.15 is able to emulate 2.0 behavior using the `enable_v2_behavior()` function.\nThis enables writing forward compatible code: by explicitly importing either `tensorflow.compat.v1` or `tensorflow.compat.v2`, you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of 1.15 or 2.0.\n* EagerTensor now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors.\n* Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()` for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\n* Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\n* AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions, allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with `tf.data`, `tf.distribute` and `tf.keras` APIS.\n* Adds `enable_tensor_equality()`, which switches the behavior such that:\n  * Tensors are no longer hashable.\n  * Tensors can be compared with `==` and `!=`, yielding a Boolean Tensor with element-wise comparison results. This will be the default behavior in 2.0.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n* Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: `tensorflow_core` containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and `tensorflow` which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to `tensorflow_core` (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\n* TensorFlow 1.15 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config. To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel.\n  * `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently, `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed.\n  * Layers now default to `float32`, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used `float64`, it will probably silently use `float32` in TensorFlow2, and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer \"layer-name\" is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\n  * Some `tf.assert_*` methods now raise assertions at operation creation time (i.e. when this Python line executes) if the input tensors' values are known at that time, not during the session.run(). When this happens, a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked non-feedable. In other words, if they are used as keys in `feed_dict` argument to `session.run()`, an error will be raised. Also, because some assert ops don't make it into the graph, the graph structure changes. A different graph can result in different per-op random seeds when they are not given explicitly (most often).\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* `tf.estimator`:\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to `tf.train.Checkpoint` format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\n  * Fix tests in canned estimators.\n  * Expose Head as public API.\n  * Fixes critical bugs that help with `DenseFeatures` usability in TF2\n* `tf.data`:\n  * Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\n  * Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to tf.train.Checkpoint format, which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with `model.load_weights`.\n  * Saving a Keras Model using `tf.saved_model.save` now saves the list of variables, trainable variables, regularization losses, and the call function.\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\n  * Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D` and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor` to store weights,  allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\n  * Enable the Keras compile API `experimental_run_tf_function` flag by default. This flag enables single training/eval/predict execution path. With this 1. All input types are converted to `Dataset`. 2. When distribution strategy is not specified this goes through the no-op distribution strategy path. 3. Execution is wrapped in tf.function unless `run_eagerly=True` is set in compile.\n  * Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is dataset/generator/keras sequence.\n* `tf.lite`\n  * Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\n  * tflite object detection script has a debug mode.\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\n  * Added evaluation script for COCO minival.\n  * Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\n  * Converts hardswish subgraphs into atomic ops.\n* Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\n* `parallel_for`: Add converter for `MatrixDiag`.\n* Add `narrow_range` attribute to `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` and V3.\n* Added new op: `tf.strings.unsorted_segment_join`.\n* Add HW acceleration support for `topK_v2`.\n* Add new `TypeSpec` classes.\n* CloudBigtable version updated to v0.10.0.\n* Expose `Head` as public API.\n* Update docstring for gather to properly describe the non-empty `batch_dims` case.\n* Added `tf.sparse.from_dense` utility function.\n* Improved ragged tensor support in `TensorFlowTestCase`.\n* Makes the a-normal form transformation in Pyct configurable as to which nodes are converted to variables and which are not.\n* `ResizeInputTensor` now works for all delegates.\n* Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST:  expand_dims_test\n* `tf.cond` emits a StatelessIf op if the branch functions are stateless and do not touch any resources.\n* `tf.cond`, `tf.while` and `if` and `while` in AutoGraph now accept a nonscalar predicate if has a single element.

We have also released a collection of [tutorials and getting started guides](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).\n\n## Highlights\n\n*   TF 2.0 delivers Keras as the central high level API used to build and train\n    models. Keras provides several model-building APIs such as Sequential,\n    Functional, and Subclassing along with eager execution, for immediate\n    iteration and intuitive debugging, and `tf.data`, for building scalable\n    input pipelines. Checkout\n    [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/keras/overview) for additional\n    details.\n*   Distribution Strategy: TF 2.0 users will be able to use the\n    [`tf.distribute.Strategy`](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy)\n    API to distribute training with minimal code changes, yielding great\n    out-of-the-box performance. It supports distributed training with Keras\n    model.fit, as well as with custom training loops. Multi-GPU support is\n    available, along with experimental support for multi worker and Cloud TPUs.\n    Check out the\n    [guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/guide/distribute_strategy) for more\n    details.\n*   Functions, not Sessions. The traditional declarative programming model of\n    building a graph and executing it via a `tf.Session` is discouraged, and\n    replaced with by writing regular Python functions. Using the `tf.function`\n    decorator, such functions can be turned into graphs which can be executed\n    remotely, serialized, and optimized for performance.\n*   Unification of `tf.train.Optimizers` and `tf.keras.Optimizers`. Use\n    `tf.keras.Optimizers` for TF2.0. `compute_gradients` is removed as public\n    API, use `GradientTape` to compute gradients.\n*   AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions,\n    allowing users to write regular Python inside `tf.function`-decorated\n    functions. AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tf.data,\n    tf.distribute and tf.keras APIs.\n*   Unification of exchange formats to SavedModel. All TensorFlow ecosystem\n    projects (TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow JS, TensorFlow Serving, TensorFlow\n    Hub) accept SavedModels. Model state should be saved to and restored from\n    SavedModels.\n*   API Changes: Many API symbols have been renamed or removed, and argument\n    names have changed. Many of these changes are motivated by consistency and\n    clarity. The 1.x API remains available in the compat.v1 module. A list of\n    all symbol changes can be found\n    [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FLFJLzg7WNP6JHODX5q8BDgptKafq_slHpnHVbJIteQ/edit#gid=0).\n    *   API clean-up, included removing `tf.app`, `tf.flags`, and `tf.logging`\n        in favor of [absl-py](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py).\n*   No more global variables with helper methods like\n    `tf.global_variables_initializer` and `tf.get_global_step`.\n*   Add toggles `tf.enable_control_flow_v2()` and `tf.disable_control_flow_v2()`\n    for enabling/disabling v2 control flow.\n*   Enable v2 control flow as part of `tf.enable_v2_behavior()` and\n    `TF2_BEHAVIOR=1`.\n*   Fixes autocomplete for most TensorFlow API references by switching to use\n    relative imports in API `__init__.py` files.\n*   Auto Mixed-Precision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to\n    `float16` for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores. This feature\n    can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with\n    `tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite()`.\n*   Add environment variable `TF_CUDNN_DETERMINISTIC`. Setting to \"true\" or \"1\"\n    forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and max-pooling\n    algorithms. When this is enabled, the algorithm selection procedure itself\n    is also deterministic.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n* Many backwards incompatible API changes have been made to clean up the APIs and make them more consistent.\n* Toolchains:\n  * TensorFlow 2.0.0 is built using devtoolset7 (GCC7) on Ubuntu 16. This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow.\n  * Tensorflow code now produces 2 different pip packages: tensorflow_core containing all the code (in the future it will contain only the private implementation) and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflow_core (and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow). We don't expect this to be breaking, unless you were importing directly from the implementation.\n  Removed the `freeze_graph` command line tool; `SavedModel` should be used in place of frozen graphs.\n\n* `tf.contrib`:\n  * `tf.contrib` has been deprecated, and functionality has been either migrated to the core TensorFlow API, to an ecosystem project such as [tensorflow/addons](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons) or [tensorflow/io](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/io), or removed entirely.\n  * Remove `tf.contrib.timeseries` dependency on TF distributions.\n  * Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis in `early_stopping.py`.\n\n* `tf.estimator`:\n  * Premade estimators in the tf.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined family have been updated to use `tf.keras.optimizers` instead of the `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer`s. If you do not pass in an `optimizer=` arg or if you use a string, the premade estimator will use the Keras optimizer. This is checkpoint breaking, as the optimizers have separate variables. A checkpoint converter tool for converting optimizers is included with the release,  but if you want to avoid any change, switch to the v1 version of the estimator:  `tf.compat.v1.estimator.DNN/Linear/DNNLinearCombined*`.\n  * Default aggregation for canned Estimators is now `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. To maintain previous default behavior, please pass `SUM` as the loss aggregation method.\n  * Canned Estimators don\u2019t support `input_layer_partitioner` arg in the API. If you have this arg, you will have to switch to `tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators`.\n  * `Estimator.export_savedmodel` has been renamed to `export_saved_model`.\n  * When saving to SavedModel, Estimators will strip default op attributes. This is almost always the correct behavior, as it is more forwards compatible, but if you require that default attributes to be saved with the model, please use `tf.compat.v1.Estimator`.\n  * Feature Columns have been upgraded to be more Eager-friendly and to work with Keras. As a result, `tf.feature_column.input_layer` has been deprecated in favor of `tf.keras.layers.DenseFeatures`. v1 feature columns have direct analogues in v2 except for `shared_embedding_columns`, which are not cross-compatible with v1 and v2. Use `tf.feature_column.shared_embeddings` instead.\n\n* `tf.keras`:\n  * `OMP_NUM_THREADS` is no longer used by the default Keras config.  To configure the number of threads, use `tf.config.threading` APIs.\n  * `tf.keras.model.save_model` and `model.save` now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel. HDF5 files are still supported.\n  * Deprecated `tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model` and `tf.keras.experimental.function`. Please use `tf.keras.models.save_model(..., save_format='tf')` and `tf.keras.models.load_model` instead.\n  * Layers now default to float32, and automatically cast their inputs to the layer's dtype. If you had a model that used float64, it will probably silently use float32 in TensorFlow 2, and a warning will be issued that starts with `Layer <layer-name>` is casting an input tensor from dtype float64 to the layer's dtype of float32. To fix, either set the default dtype to float64 with `tf.keras.backend.set_floatx('float64')`, or pass `dtype='float64'` to each of the Layer constructors. See `tf.keras.layers.Layer` for more information.\n\n* `tf.lite`:\n  * Removed `lite.OpHint`, `lite.experimental`, and `lite.constant` from 2.0 API.\n* Tensors are no longer hashable, but instead compare element-wise with `==` and `!=`. Use `tf.compat.v1.disable_tensor_equality()` to return to the previous behavior.\n* Performing equality operations on Tensors or Variables with incompatible shapes an exception is no longer thrown. Instead `__eq__` returns False and `__ne__` returns True.\n* Removed `tf.string_split` from v2 API.\n* Deprecated the use of `constraint=` and `.constraint` with ResourceVariable.\n* Add `UnifiedGRU` as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the default recurrent activation function for GRU from `hard_sigmoid` to `sigmoid`, and `reset_after` to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is `hard_sigmoid` since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please construct the layer with GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback to 1.x behavior.\n* `CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH`, `TENSORRT_INSTALL_PATH`, `NCCL_INSTALL_PATH`, `NCCL_HDR_PATH` are deprecated. Use `TF_CUDA_PATHS` instead which supports a comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA libraries and headers.\n\nRefer to our [public project status tracker](https://github.com/orgs/tensorflow/projects/4) and [issues tagged with `2.0`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A2.0) on GitHub for insight into recent issues and development progress.\n\nIf you experience any snags when using TF 2.0, please let us know at the [TF 2.0 Testing User Group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/testing). We have a support mailing list as well as weekly testing meetings, and would love to hear your migration feedback and questions.\n\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   `tf.contrib`:\n\n    *   Expose `tf.contrib.proto.*` ops in `tf.io` (they will exist in TF2)\n\n*   `tf.data`:\n\n    *   Add support for TensorArrays to `tf.data Dataset`.\n    *   Integrate Ragged Tensors with `tf.data`.\n    *   All core and experimental tf.data transformations that input\n        user-defined functions can span multiple devices now.\n    *   Extending the TF 2.0 support for `shuffle(...,\n        reshuffle_each_iteration=True)` and `cache()` to work across different\n        Python iterators for the same dataset.\n    *   Removing the `experimental_numa_aware` option from `tf.data.Options`.\n    *   Add `num_parallel_reads` and passing in a Dataset containing filenames\n        into `TextLineDataset` and `FixedLengthRecordDataset`.\n    *   Add support for defaulting the value of `cycle_length` argument of\n        `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` to the number of schedulable CPU cores.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.enumerate_dataset` to core as\n        `tf.data.Dataset.enumerate`.\n    *   Promoting `tf.data.experimental.unbatch` to core as\n        `tf.data.Dataset.unbatch`.\n    *   Adds option for introducing slack in the pipeline to reduce CPU\n        contention, via `tf.data.Options().experimental_slack = True`\n    *   Added experimental support for parallel batching to `batch()` and\n        `padded_batch()`. This functionality can be enabled through\n        `tf.data.Options()`.\n    *   Support cancellation of long-running `reduce`.\n    *   Now we use `dataset` node name as prefix instead of the op name, to\n        identify the component correctly in metrics, for pipelines with repeated\n        components.\n    *   Improve the performance of datasets using `from_tensors()`.\n    *   Promoting `unbatch` from experimental to core API.\n    *   Adding support for datasets as inputs to `from_tensors` and\n        `from_tensor_slices` and batching and unbatching of nested datasets.\n\n*   `tf.distribute`:\n\n    *   Enable `tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` working\n        in eager mode.\n    *   Callbacks are supported in `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`.\n    *   Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic\n        tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\n    *   Loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled w.r.t.\n        the global batch size when using a `tf.distribute.Strategy`.\n    *   Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss\n        scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO`\n        indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage\n        context. For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`.\n        When used in distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training\n        loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value\n        to be 'None' or 'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\n    *   Support for multi-host `ncclAllReduce` in Distribution Strategy.\n\n*   `tf.estimator`:\n\n    *   Replace `tf.contrib.estimator.add_metrics` with\n        `tf.estimator.add_metrics`\n    *   Use `tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs` instead of `tf.estimator.inputs`\n    *   Replace contrib references with `tf.estimator.experimental.*` for apis\n        in early_s in Estimator\n    *   Canned Estimators will now use keras optimizers by default. An error\n        will be raised if tf.train.Optimizers are used, and you will have to\n        switch to tf.keras.optimizers or tf.compat.v1 canned Estimators.\n    *   A checkpoint converter for canned Estimators has been provided to\n        transition canned Estimators that are warm started from\n        `tf.train.Optimizers` to `tf.keras.optimizers`.\n    *   Losses are scaled in canned estimator v2 and not in the optimizers\n        anymore. If you are using Estimator + distribution strategy + optimikzer\n        v1 then the behavior does not change. This implies that if you are using\n        custom estimator with optimizer v2, you have to scale losses. We have\n        new utilities to help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`,\n        `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\n\n*   `tf.keras`:\n\n    *   Premade models (including Linear and WideDeep) have been introduced for\n        the purpose of replacing Premade estimators.\n    *   Model saving changes\n    *   `model.save` and `tf.saved_model.save` may now save to the TensorFlow\n        SavedModel format. The model can be restored using\n        `tf.keras.models.load_model`. HDF5 files are still supported, and may be\n        used by specifying `save_format=\"h5\"` when saving.\n    *   Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras\n        Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users\n        to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API.\n        Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable\n        creation or assign ops are not supported.\n    *   Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` argument in Keras\n        `compile`.\n    *   Add `tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell` as the preferred implementation\n        for RNN cells in TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cells with\n        custom behavior.\n    *   Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot when\n        using the TensorBoard callback.\n    *   Switched Keras `fit/evaluate/predict` execution to use only a single\n        unified path by default unless eager execution has been explicitly\n        disabled, regardless of input type. This unified path places an\n        eager-friendly training step inside of a `tf.function`. With this\n    *   All input types are converted to `Dataset`.\n    *   The path assumes there is always a distribution strategy. when\n        distribution strategy is not specified the path uses a no-op\n        distribution strategy.\n    *   The training step is wrapped in `tf.function` unless `run_eagerly=True`\n        is set in compile. The single path execution code does not yet support\n        all use cases. We fallback to the existing v1 execution paths if your\n        model contains the following:\n        1.  `sample_weight_mode` in compile\n        2.  `weighted_metrics` in compile\n        3.  v1 optimizer\n        4.  target tensors in compile If you are experiencing any issues because\n            of this change, please inform us (file an issue) about your use case\n            and you can unblock yourself by setting\n            `experimental_run_tf_function=False` in compile meanwhile. We have\n            seen couple of use cases where the model usage pattern is not as\n            expected and would not work with this change.\n    *   output tensors of one layer is used in the constructor of another.\n    *   symbolic tensors outside the scope of the model are used in custom loss\n        functions. The flag can be disabled for these cases and ideally the\n        usage pattern will need to be fixed.\n    *   Mark Keras `set_session` as `compat.v1` only.\n    *   `tf.keras.estimator.model_to_estimator` now supports exporting to\n        `tf.train.Checkpoint format`, which allows the saved checkpoints to be\n        compatible with `model.load_weights`.\n    *   `keras.backend.resize_images` (and consequently,\n        `keras.layers.Upsampling2D`) behavior has changed, a bug in the resizing\n        implementation was fixed.\n    *   Add an `implementation=3` mode for `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D`\n        and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D` layers using `tf.SparseTensor`\n        to store weights, allowing a dramatic speedup for large sparse models.\n    *   Raise error if `batch_size` argument is used when input is\n        dataset/generator/keras sequence.\n    *   Update TF 2.0 `keras.backend.name_scope` to use TF 2.0 `name_scope`.\n    *   Add v2 module aliases for losses, metrics, initializers and optimizers:\n        `tf.losses = tf.keras.losses` & `tf.metrics = tf.keras.metrics` &\n        `tf.initializers = tf.keras.initializers` & `tf.optimizers =\n        tf.keras.optimizers`.\n    *   Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities.\n        Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross\n        entropy formula for probabilities.\n    *   Added public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\n    *   Add support for temporal sample weight mode in subclassed models.\n    *   Raise `ValueError` if an integer is passed to the training APIs.\n    *   Added fault-tolerance support for training Keras model via `model.fit()`\n        with `MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy`, tutorial available.\n    *   Custom Callback tutorial is now available.\n    *   To train with `tf.distribute`, Keras API is recommended over estimator.\n    *   `steps_per_epoch` and `steps` arguments are supported with numpy arrays.\n    *   New error message when unexpected keys are used in\n        sample_weight/class_weight dictionaries\n    *   Losses are scaled in Keras compile/fit and not in the optimizers\n        anymore. If you are using custom training loop, we have new utilities to\n        help scale losses `tf.nn.compute_average_loss`,\n        `tf.nn.scale_regularization_loss`.\n    *   `Layer` apply and add_variable APIs are deprecated.\n    *   Added support for channels first data format in cross entropy losses\n        with logits and support for tensors with unknown ranks.\n    *   Error messages will be raised if `add_update`, `add_metric`, `add_loss`,\n        activity regularizers are used inside of a control flow branch.\n    *   New loss reduction types:\n    *   `AUTO`: Indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the\n        usage context. For almost all cases this defaults to\n        `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used with `tf.distribute.Strategy`, outside\n        of built-in training loops such as `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we\n        expect reduction value to be `SUM` or `NONE`. Using `AUTO` in that case\n        will raise an error.\n    *   `NONE`: Weighted losses with one dimension reduced (axis=-1, or axis\n        specified by loss function). When this reduction type used with built-in\n        Keras training loops like `fit`/`evaluate`, the unreduced vector loss is\n        passed to the optimizer but the reported loss will be a scalar value.\n    *   `SUM`: Scalar sum of weighted losses. 4. `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`: Scalar\n        `SUM` divided by number of elements in losses. This reduction type is\n        not supported when used with `tf.distribute.Strategy` outside of\n        built-in training loops like `tf.keras` `compile`/`fit`.\n    *   Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which\n        are not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All\n        losses will now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\n    *   `model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor)` should work in ambient eager.\n    *   Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in compile.\n        Affects following cases\n    *   When name is given as 'accuracy'/'crossentropy'\n    *   When an aliased function name is used eg. 'mse'\n    *   Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\n    *   Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\n    *   Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\n    *   Add v2 APIs for `AUCCurve` and `AUCSummationMethod` enums.\n    *   `add_update` can now be passed a zero-arg callable in order to support\n        turning off the update when setting `trainable=False` on a Layer of a\n        Model compiled with `run_eagerly=True`.\n    *   Standardize the LayerNormalization API by replacing the args `norm_axis`\n        and `params_axis` with `axis`.\n    *   Fixed critical bugs that help with DenseFeatures usability in TF2\n\n*   `tf.lite`:\n\n    *   Added evaluation script for `COCO` minival\n    *   Add delegate support for `QUANTIZE`.\n    *   Add `GATHER` support to NN API delegate.\n    *   Added support for TFLiteConverter Python API in 2.0. Contains functions\n        from_saved_model, from_keras_file, and from_concrete_functions.\n    *   Add `EXPAND_DIMS` support to NN API delegate TEST.\n    *   Add `narrow_range` attribute to QuantizeAndDequantizeV2 and V3.\n    *   Added support for `tflite_convert` command line tool in 2.0.\n    *   Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by\n        multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use\n        INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from\n        this version onwards.\n    *   Post-training quantization tool supports fp16 weights and GPU delegate\n        acceleration for fp16.\n    *   Add delegate support for `QUANTIZED_16BIT_LSTM`.\n    *   Extracts `NNAPIDelegateKernel` from nnapi_delegate.cc\n\n*   TensorRT\n\n    *   Add TensorFlow 2.0-compatible `TrtGraphConverterV2` API for TensorRT\n        conversion. TensorRT initialization arguments are now passed wrapped in\n        a named-tuple, `TrtConversionParams`, rather than as separate arguments\n        as in `TrtGraphConverter`.\n    *   Changed API to optimize TensorRT engines during graph optimization. This\n        is now done by calling `converter.build()` where previously\n        `is_dynamic_op=False` would be set.\n    *   `converter.convert()` no longer returns a `tf.function`. Now the\n        function must be accessed from the saved model.\n    *   The `converter.calibrate()` method has been removed. To trigger\n        calibration, a `calibration_input_fn` should be provided to\n        `converter.convert()`.\n\n*   Other:\n\n    *   Fix accidental quadratic graph construction cost in graph-mode\n        `tf.gradients()`.\n    *   ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\n    *   ResourceVariable support for `gather_nd`.\n    *   `ResourceVariable` and `Variable` no longer accepts `constraint` in the\n        constructor, nor expose it as a @property.\n    *   Added gradient for `SparseToDense` op.\n    *   Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python\n        benchmarks.\n    *   `image.resize` in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\n    *   `image.resize` now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels\n        (incl. anti-aliasing).\n    *   Renamed `tf.image` functions to remove duplicate \"image\" where it is\n        redundant.\n    *   Variadic reduce is supported on CPU Variadic reduce is supported on CPU\n    *   Remove unused `StringViewVariantWrapper`.\n    *   Delete unused `Fingerprint64Map` op registration\n    *   Add broadcasting support to `tf.matmul`.\n    *   Add C++ Gradient for `BatchMatMulV2`.\n    *   Add `tf.math.cumulative_logsumexp` operation.\n    *   Add ellipsis (...) support for `tf.einsum()`.\n    *   Add expand_composites argument to all `nest.*` methods.\n    *

`tf.strings.split` to support inputs with any rank.\n    *   Added `tf.random.binomial`.\n    *   Added `key` and `skip` methods to `random.experimental.Generator`.\n    *   Extend `tf.function` with basic support for CompositeTensors arguments\n        (such as `SparseTensor` and `RaggedTensor`).\n    *   `parallel_for.pfor`: add converters for Softmax, LogSoftmax, IsNaN, All,\n        Any, and MatrixSetDiag.\n    *   `parallel_for`: add converters for LowerTriangularSolve and Cholesky.\n    *   `parallel_for`: add converters for `LogMatrixDeterminant` and\n        `MatrixBandPart`.\n    *   `parallel_for`: Add converter for `MatrixDiag`.\n    *   `parallel_for`: Add converters for `OneHot`, `LowerBound`, `UpperBound`.\n    *   `parallel_for`: add converter for `BroadcastTo`.\n    *   Add `pfor` converter for `Squeeze`.\n    *   Add `RaggedTensor.placeholder()`.\n    *   Add ragged tensor support to `tf.squeeze`.\n    *   Update RaggedTensors to support int32 row_splits.\n    *   Allow `LinearOperator.solve` to take a `LinearOperator`.\n    *   Allow all dtypes for `LinearOperatorCirculant`.\n    *   Introduce MaxParallelism method\n    *   Add `LinearOperatorHouseholder`.\n    *

in AutoGraph now accept a\n        nonscalar predicate if has a single element. This does not affect non-V2\n        control flow.\n    *   Fix potential security vulnerability where decoding variant tensors from\n        proto could result in heap out of bounds memory access.\n    *   Only create a GCS directory object if the object does not already exist.\n    *   Introduce `dynamic` constructor argument in Layer and Model, which\n        should be set to `True` when using imperative control flow in the `call`\n        method.\n    *   Begin adding Go wrapper for C Eager API.\n    *   XLA HLO graphs can be inspected with interactive_graphviz tool now.\n    *   Add dataset ops to the graph (or create kernels in Eager execution)\n        during the python Dataset object creation instead doing it during\n        Iterator creation time.\n    *   Add `batch_dims` argument to `tf.gather`.\n    *   The behavior of `tf.gather` is now correct when `axis=None` and\n        `batch_dims<0`.\n    *   Update docstring for gather to properly describe the non-empty\n        `batch_dims` case.\n    *   Removing of dtype in the constructor of initializers and partition_info\n        in call.\n    *   Add `tf.math.nextafter` op.\n    *   Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically\n        dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector\n        architecture. To disable them, build with\n        `--define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0`.\n    *   `tf.linspace(start, stop, num)` now always uses \"stop\" as last value\n        (for num > 1)\n    *   Added top-k to precision and recall to keras metrics.\n    *   Add a ragged size op and register it to the op dispatcher\n    *   Transitive dependencies on :`pooling_ops` were removed.

This module\n    is required to allow libraries to publish code which works in both 1.x and\n    2.x. After this release, no backwards incompatible changes are allowed in\n    the 2.0 Python API.\n*   Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically\n    dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector architecture.\n    To disable them, build with --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\n\n## Behavioral changes\n\n*   Set default loss reduction as `AUTO` for improving reliability of loss\n    scaling with distribution strategy and custom training loops. `AUTO`\n    indicates that the reduction option will be determined by the usage context.\n    For almost all cases this defaults to `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE`. When used in\n    distribution strategy scope, outside of built-in training loops such as\n    `tf.keras` `compile` and `fit`, we expect reduction value to be 'None' or\n    'SUM'. Using other values will raise an error.\n*   Wraps losses passed to the `compile` API (strings and v1 losses) which are\n    not instances of v2 `Loss` class in `LossWrapper` class. => All losses will\n    now use `SUM_OVER_BATCH_SIZE` reduction as default.\n*   Disable `run_eagerly` and distribution strategy if there are symbolic\n    tensors added to the model using `add_metric` or `add_loss`.\n*   tf.linspace(start, stop, num) now always uses \"stop\" as last value (for\n    num > 1)\n*   `ResourceVariable` and `Variable` no longer accepts `constraint` in the\n    constructor, nor expose it as a @property.\n*   The behavior of tf.gather is now correct when axis=None and batch_dims<0.\n*   Only create a GCS directory object if the object does not already exist.\n*   In `map_vectorization` optimization, reduce the degree of parallelism in the\n    vectorized map node.\n*   Bug fix: loss and gradients should now more reliably be correctly scaled\n    w.r.t. the global batch size when using a tf.distribute.Strategy.\n*   Updating cosine similarity loss - removed the negate sign from cosine\n    similarity.\n*   DType is no longer convertible to an int. Use dtype.as_datatype_enum instead\n    of int(dtype) to get the same result.\n*   Changed default for gradient accumulation for TPU embeddings to true.\n*   Callbacks now log values in eager mode when a deferred build model is used.\n*   Transitive dependencies on :pooling_ops were removed. Some users may need to\n    add explicit dependencies on :pooling_ops if they reference the operators\n    from that library.\n*   tf.keras.optimizers default learning rate changes:\n    *   Adadelta: 1.000 to 0.001\n    *   Adagrad: 0.01 to 0.001\n    *   Adamax: 0.002 to 0.001\n    *   NAdam: 0.002 to 0.001\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   Documentation\n*   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n    *   Remove unused StringViewVariantWrapper\n    *   Delete unused Fingerprint64Map op registration\n    *   SignatureDef util functions have been deprecated.\n    *   Renamed tf.image functions to remove duplicate \"image\" where it is\n        redundant.\n    *   tf.keras.experimental.export renamed to\n        tf.keras.experimental.export_saved_model\n    *   Standardize the LayerNormalization API by replacing the args `norm_axis`\n        and `params_axis` with `axis`.\n    *   Tensor::UnsafeCopyFromInternal deprecated in favor Tensor::BitcastFrom\n*   Keras & Python API\n    *   Add v2 module aliases for:\n    *   tf.initializers => tf.keras.initializers\n    *   tf.losses => tf.keras.losses & tf.metrics => tf.keras.metrics\n    *   tf.optimizers => tf.keras.optimizers\n    *   Add tf.keras.layers.AbstractRNNCell as the preferred implementation of\n        RNN cell for TF v2. User can use it to implement RNN cell with custom\n        behavior.\n    *   Adding `clear_losses` API to be able to clear losses at the end of\n        forward pass in a custom training loop in eager.\n    *   Add support for passing list of lists to the `metrics` param in Keras\n        `compile`.\n    *   Added top-k to precision and recall to keras metrics.\n    *   Adding public APIs for `cumsum` and `cumprod` keras backend functions.\n    *   Fix: model.add_loss(symbolic_tensor) should work in ambient eager.\n    *   Add name argument to tf.string_split and tf.strings_split\n    *   Minor change to SavedModels exported from Keras using\n        tf.keras.experimental.export. (SignatureDef key for evaluation mode is\n        now \"eval\" instead of \"test\"). This will be reverted back to \"test\" in\n        the near future.\n    *   Updates binary cross entropy logic in Keras when input is probabilities.\n        Instead of converting probabilities to logits, we are using the cross\n        entropy formula for probabilities.\n    *   Raw TensorFlow functions can now be used in conjunction with the Keras\n        Functional API during model creation. This obviates the need for users\n        to create Lambda layers in most cases when using the Functional API.\n        Like Lambda layers, TensorFlow functions that result in Variable\n        creation or assign ops are not supported.\n    *   Keras training and validation curves are shown on the same plot.\n    *   Introduce `dynamic` constructor argument in Layer and Model, which\n        should be set to True when using imperative control flow in the `call`\n        method.\n    *   Removing of dtype in the constructor of initializers and partition_info\n        in call.\n*   New ops and improved op functionality\n    *   Add OpKernels for some stateless maps\n    *   Add v2 APIs for AUCCurve and AUCSummationMethod\n        enums. #tf-metrics-convergence\n    *   Add tf.math.nextafter op.\n    *   Add CompositeTensor base class.\n    *   Add tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve op.\n    *   Add opkernel templates for common table operations.\n    *   Added support for TFLite in TensorFlow 2.0.\n    *   Adds summary trace API for collecting graph and profile information.\n    *   Add batch_dims argument to tf.gather.\n    *   Add support for `add_metric` in the graph function mode.\n    *   Add C++ Gradient for BatchMatMulV2.\n    *   Added tf.random.binomial\n    *   Added gradient for SparseToDense op.\n    *   Add legacy string flat hash map op kernels\n    *   Add a ragged size op and register it to the op dispatcher\n    *   Add broadcasting support to tf.matmul.\n    *   Add ellipsis (...) support for tf.einsum()\n    *   Added LinearOperator.adjoint and LinearOperator.H (alias).\n    *   Added GPU implementation of tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve.\n    *   Added strings.byte_split\n    *   Add RaggedTensor.placeholder()\n    *   Add a new \"result_type\" parameter to tf.strings.split\n    *   `add_update` can now be passed a zero-arg callable in order to support\n        turning off the update when setting `trainable=False` on a Layer of a\n        Model compiled with `run_eagerly=True`.\n    *   Add variant wrapper for absl::string_view\n    *   Add expand_composites argument to all nest.* methods.\n    *   Add pfor converter for Squeeze.\n    *   Bug fix for tf.tile gradient\n    *   Expose CriticalSection in core as tf.CriticalSection.\n    *   Update Fingerprint64Map to use aliases\n    *   ResourceVariable support for gather_nd.\n    *   ResourceVariable's gather op supports batch dimensions.\n    *   Variadic reduce is supported on CPU\n    *   Extend tf.function with basic support for CompositeTensors arguments\n        (such as SparseTensor and RaggedTensor).\n    *   Add templates and interfaces for creating lookup tables\n    *   Post-training quantization tool supports quantizing weights shared by\n        multiple operations. The models made with versions of this tool will use\n        INT8 types for weights and will only be executable interpreters from\n        this version onwards.\n    *   Malformed gif images could result in an access out of bounds in the\n        color palette of the frame. This has been fixed now\n    *   image.resize now considers proper pixel centers and has new kernels\n        (incl. anti-aliasing).\n    *   Added an isotonic regression solver (tf.nn.isotonic_regression).\n*   Performance\n    *   Turn on MKL-DNN contraction kernels by default. MKL-DNN dynamically\n        dispatches the best kernel implementation based on CPU vector\n        architecture. To disable them, build with\n        --define=tensorflow_mkldnn_contraction_kernel=0.\n    *   Support for multi-host ncclAllReduce in Distribution Strategy.\n    *   Expose a flag that allows the number of threads to vary across Python\n        benchmarks.\n*   TensorFlow 2.0 Development\n    *   Add v2 sparse categorical crossentropy metric.\n    *   Allow non-Tensors through v2 losses.\n    *   Add UnifiedGRU as the new GRU implementation for tf2.0. Change the\n        default recurrent activation function for GRU from 'hard_sigmoid' to\n        'sigmoid', and 'reset_after' to True in 2.0. Historically recurrent\n        activation is 'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new\n        unified backend between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is\n        using sigmoid, we change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well.\n        With that, the default GRU will be compatible with both CPU and GPU\n        kernel. This will enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default\n        and get a 10x performance boost in training. Note that this is\n        checkpoint breaking change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained\n        checkpoint, please construct the layer with\n        GRU(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid', reset_after=False) to fallback\n        to 1.x behavior.\n    *   TF 2.0 - Update metric name to always reflect what the user has given in\n        compile. Affects following cases 1. When name is given as\n        'accuracy'/'crossentropy' 2. When an aliased function name is used eg.\n        'mse' 3. Removing the `weighted` prefix from weighted metric names.\n    *   Begin adding Go wrapper for C Eager API\n    *   image.resize in 2.0 now supports gradients for the new resize kernels.\n    *   removed tf.string_split from v2 API\n    *   Expose tf.contrib.proto.* ops in tf.io (they will exist in TF2)\n    *   \"Updates the TFLiteConverter API in 2.0. Changes from_concrete_function\n        to from_concrete_functions.\"\n    *   Enable tf.distribute.experimental.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy working in\n        eager mode.\n    *   Support both binary and -1/1 label input in v2 hinge and squared hinge\n        losses.\n*   TensorFlow Lite\n    *   \"Adds support for tflite_convert in 2.0.\"\n    *   \"Remove lite.OpHint, lite.experimental, and lite.constant from 2.0 API.\"\n*   tf.contrib\n    *   Added Neural Turing Implementation as described in\n        https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08518.\n    *   Remove tf.contrib.timeseries dependency on TF distributions.\n*   tf.data\n    *   Add num_parallel_reads and passing in a Dataset containing filenames\n        into TextLineDataset and FixedLengthRecordDataset\n    *   Going forward we operate in TF 2.0, this change is part of the effort to\n        slowly converting XYZDataset to DatasetV2 type which is the official\n        version going to be used in TF 2.0 and motivated by some compatibility\n        issue found, _BigtableXYZDataset (of type DatasetV2) does not implement\n        the _as_variant_tensor() of DatasetV1, when moving contrib.bigtable to\n        tensorflow_io. Converting into DatasetV2 removes the overheads to\n        maintain V1 while we are moving into TF 2.0.\n    *   Add dataset ops to the graph (or create kernels in Eager execution)\n        during the python Dataset object creation instead doing it during\n        Iterator creation time.\n    *   Add support for TensorArrays to tf.data Dataset.\n    *   Switching tf.data functions to use `defun`, providing an escape hatch to\n        continue using the legacy `Defun`.\n*   Toolchains\n    *   CUDNN_INSTALL_PATH, TENSORRT_INSTALL_PATH, NCCL_INSTALL_PATH,\n        NCCL_HDR_PATH are deprecated. Use TF_CUDA_PATHS instead which supports a\n        comma-separated list of base paths that are searched to find CUDA\n        libraries and headers.\n    *   TF code now resides in `tensorflow_core` and `tensorflow` is just a\n        virtual pip package. No code changes are needed for projects using\n        TensorFlow, the change is transparent\n*   XLA\n    *   XLA HLO graphs can be inspected with interactive_graphviz tool now.\n*   Estimator\n    *   Use tf.compat.v1.estimator.inputs instead of tf.estimator.inputs\n    *   Replace contrib references with tf.estimator.experimental.* for apis in\n        early_stopping.py\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n1e100, 4d55397500, a6802739, abenmao, Adam Weiss, Ag Ramesh, Alan Du, Albin Joy,\nAlex, Aman Patel, Amit, Amit Kumar Jaiswal, Amit Srivastava, Andreas Eberle,\nAndy Craze, Anthony Platanios, Armen Poghosov, armenpoghosov, arp95, Arpit Shah,\nAshwin Ramaswami, Aurelien Geron, Aur\u00e9Lien Geron, aweers, awesomealex1, Ayush\nAgrawal, Ben Barsdell, Bharat Raghunathan, Bhavani Subramanian, blairhan,\nBl\u00e9Nesi Attila, Brandon Carter, candy.dc, Chao Liu, chenchc, chie8842, Christian\nHansen, Christian Sigg, Clayne Robison, crafet, csukuangfj, ctiijima, Dan\nJarvis, Dan Lazewatsky, Daniel Ingram, Daniel Salvadori, Dave Airlie, David\nNorman, Dayananda V, Dayananda-V, delock, Denis Khalikov, Deven Desai, Dheeraj\nRajaram Reddy, dmitrievanthony, Donovan Ong, Drew Szurko, Duncan Riach, Dustin\nNeighly, Edward Forgacs, EFanZh, Fei Hu, Felix Lemke, Filip Matzner, fo40225,\nfrreiss, Gautam, gehring, Geoffrey Irving, Grzegorz George Pawelczak, Grzegorz\nPawelczak, Gyoung-Yoon Ryoo, HanGuo97, Hanton Yang, Hari Shankar, hehongliang,\nHeungsub Lee, Hoeseong Kim, I-Hong Jhuo, Ilango R, Innovimax, Irene Dea, Jacky\nKo, Jakub Lipinski, Jason Zaman, jcf94, Jeffrey Poznanovic, Jens Elofsson,\nJeroen B\u00e9Dorf, Jia Qingtong, Jiankang, Joe Q, Joe Quadrino, Joeran Beel, Jonas\nRauber, Jonathan, Jonathan Kyl, Joppe Geluykens, Joseph Friedman, jtressle, jwu,\nK Yasaswi Sri Chandra Gandhi, K.

This means that Python modules are under `tf.lite` and source code is now under `tensorflow/lite` rather than `tensorflow/contrib/lite`.\n* TensorFlow GPU binaries are now built against CUDA 10 and TensorRT 5.0.\n* Support for Python3.7 on all operating systems.\n* Moved NCCL to core.\n\n## Behavioral changes\n\n* Disallow conversion of python floating types to uint32/64 (matching behavior of other integer types) in `tf.constant`.\n* Make the `gain` argument of convolutional orthogonal initializers (`convolutional_delta_orthogonal`, `convolutional_orthogonal_1D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_2D`, `convolutional_orthogonal_3D`) have consistent behavior with the `tf.initializers.orthogonal` initializer, i.e. scale the output l2-norm by `gain` and NOT by `sqrt(gain)`. (Note that these functions are currently in `tf.contrib` which is not guaranteed backward compatible).\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   Documentation\n    *   Update the doc with the details about the rounding mode used in\n        quantize_and_dequantize_v2.\n    *   Clarify that tensorflow::port::InitMain() _should_ be called before\n        using the TensorFlow library. Programs failing to do this are not\n        portable to all platforms.\n*   Deprecations and Symbol renames.\n    *   Removing deprecations for the following endpoints: `tf.acos`,\n        `tf.acosh`, `tf.add`, `tf.as_string`, `tf.asin`, `tf.asinh`, `tf.atan`,\n        `tf.atan2`, `tf.atanh`, `tf.cos`, `tf.cosh`, `tf.equal`, `tf.exp`,\n        `tf.floor`, `tf.greater`, `tf.greater_equal`, `tf.less`,\n        `tf.less_equal`, `tf.log`, `tf.logp1`, `tf.logical_and`,\n        `tf.logical_not`, `tf.logical_or`, `tf.maximum`, `tf.minimum`,\n        `tf.not_equal`, `tf.sin`, `tf.sinh`, `tf.tan`\n    *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.shard`.\n    *   Deprecate `saved_model.loader.load` which is replaced by\n        `saved_model.load` and `saved_model.main_op`, which will be replaced by\n        `saved_model.main_op` in V2.\n    *   Deprecate tf.QUANTIZED_DTYPES. The official new symbol is\n        tf.dtypes.QUANTIZED_DTYPES.\n    *   Update sklearn imports for deprecated packages.\n    *   Deprecate `Variable.count_up_to` and `tf.count_up_to` in favor of\n        `Dataset.range`.\n    *   Export `confusion_matrix` op as `tf.math.confusion_matrix` instead of\n        `tf.train.confusion_matrix`.\n    *   Add `tf.dtypes.` endpoint for every constant in dtypes.py. Moving\n        endpoints in versions.py to corresponding endpoints in `tf.sysconfig.`\n        and `tf.version.`. Moving all constants under `tf.saved_model`\n        submodules to `tf.saved_model` module. New endpoints are added in V1 and\n        V2 but existing endpoint removals are only applied in V2.\n    *   Deprecates behavior where device assignment overrides collocation\n        constraints inside a collocation context manager.\n*   Keras & Python API\n    *   Add to Keras functionality analogous to\n        `tf.register_tensor_conversion_function`.\n    *   Subclassed Keras models can now be saved through\n        `tf.contrib.saved_model.save_keras_model`.\n    *   `LinearOperator.matmul` now returns a new `LinearOperator`.\n*   New ops and improved op functionality\n    *   Add a Nearest Neighbor Resize op.\n    *   Add an `ignore_unknown` argument to `parse_values` which suppresses\n        ValueError for unknown hyperparameter types. Such * Add\n        `tf.linalg.matvec` convenience function.\n    *   `tf.einsum()`raises `ValueError` for unsupported equations like\n        `\"ii->\"`.\n    *   Add DCT-I and IDCT-I in `tf.signal.dct` and `tf.signal.idct`.\n    *   Add LU decomposition op.\n    *   Add quantile loss to gradient boosted trees in estimator.\n    *   Add `round_mode` to `QuantizeAndDequantizeV2` op to select rounding\n        algorithm.\n    *   Add `unicode_encode`, `unicode_decode`, `unicode_decode_with_offsets`,\n        `unicode_split`, `unicode_split_with_offset`, and `unicode_transcode`\n        ops. Amongst other things, this Op adds the ability to encode, decode,\n        and transcode a variety of input text encoding formats into the main\n        Unicode encodings (UTF-8, UTF-16-BE, UTF-32-BE)\n    *   Add \"unit\" attribute to the substr op, which allows obtaining the\n        substring of a string containing unicode characters.\n    *   Broadcasting support for Ragged Tensors.\n    *   `SpaceToDepth` supports uint8 data type.\n    *   Support multi-label quantile regression in estimator.\n    *   We now use \"div\" as the default partition_strategy in\n        `tf.nn.safe_embedding_lookup_sparse`, `tf.nn.sampled_softmax` and\n        `tf.nn.nce_loss`. hyperparameter are ignored.\n*   Performance\n    *   Improve performance of GPU cumsum/cumprod by up to 300x.\n    *   Added support for weight decay in most TPU embedding optimizers,\n        including AdamW and MomentumW.\n*   TensorFlow 2.0 Development\n    *   Add a command line tool to convert to TF2.0, tf_upgrade_v2\n    *   Merge `tf.spectral` into `tf.signal` for TensorFlow 2.0.\n    *   Change the default recurrent activation function for LSTM from\n        'hard_sigmoid' to 'sigmoid' in 2.0. Historically recurrent activation is\n        'hard_sigmoid' since it is fast than 'sigmoid'. With new unified backend\n        between CPU and GPU mode, since the CuDNN kernel is using sigmoid, we\n        change the default for CPU mode to sigmoid as well. With that, the\n        default LSTM will be compatible with both CPU and GPU kernel. This will\n        enable user with GPU to use CuDNN kernel by default and get a 10x\n        performance boost in training. Note that this is checkpoint breaking\n        change. If user want to use their 1.x pre-trained checkpoint, please\n        construct the layer with LSTM(recurrent_activation='hard_sigmoid') to\n        fallback to 1.x behavior.\n*   TensorFlow Lite\n    *   Move from `tensorflow/contrib/lite` to `tensorflow/lite`.\n    *   Add experimental Java API for injecting TensorFlow Lite delegates\n    *   Add support for strings in TensorFlow Lite Java API.\n*   `tf.contrib`:\n    *   Add Apache Ignite Filesystem plugin to support accessing Apache IGFS.\n    *   Dropout now takes `rate` argument, `keep_prob` is deprecated.\n    *   Estimator occurrences references `tf.contrib.estimator` were changed to\n        `tf.estimator`:\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.BaselineEstimator` with\n        `tf.estimator.BaselineEstimator`\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator` with\n        `tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator`\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNEstimator` with `tf.estimator.DNNEstimator`\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.LinearEstimator` with\n        `tf.estimator.LinearEstimator`\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.InMemoryEvaluatorHook` and\n        tf.estimator.experimental.InMemoryEvaluatorHook`.\n    *   `tf.contrib.estimator.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook` with\n        `tf.estimator.experimental.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook`.\n    *   Expose `tf.distribute.Strategy as the new name for\n        tf.contrib.distribute.DistributionStrategy.\n    *   Migrate linear optimizer from contrib to core.\n    *   Move `tf.contrib.signal` to `tf.signal` (preserving aliases in\n        tf.contrib.signal).\n    *   Users of `tf.contrib.estimator.export_all_saved_models` and related\n        should switch to\n        `tf.estimator.Estimator.experimental_export_all_saved_models`.\n*   tf.data:\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.StatsOptions()`, to configure options to\n        collect statistics from `tf.data.Dataset` pipeline using\n        `StatsAggregator`. Add nested option, `experimental_stats` (which takes\n        a `tf.data.experimen tal.StatsOptions` object), to `tf.data.Options`.\n        Deprecates `tf.data.experimental.set_stats_agregator`.\n    *   Performance optimizations:\n    *   Add `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions()`, to configure options\n        to enable `tf.data` performance optimizations. Add nested option,\n        `experimental_optimization` (which takes a\n        `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` object), to\n        `tf.data.Options`. Remove performance optimization options from\n        `tf.data.Options`, and add them under\n        `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` instead.\n    *   Enable `map_and_batch_fusion` and `noop_elimination` optimizations by\n        default. They can be disabled by configuring\n        `tf.data.experimental.OptimizationOptions` to set `map_and_batch =\n        False` or `noop_elimination = False` respectively. To disable all\n        default optimizations, set `apply_default_optimizations = False`.\n    *   Support parallel map in `map_and_filter_fusion`.\n    *   Disable static optimizations for input pipelines that use non-resource\n        `tf.Variable`s.\n    *   Add NUMA-aware MapAndBatch dataset.\n    *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()` in V1, removed it\n        from V2, and added tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator()`.\n    *   Deprecate `tf.data.Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` in V1, removed\n        it from V2, and added `tf.compat.v1.data.make_initializable_iterator()`.\n    *   Enable nested dataset support in core `tf.data` transformations.\n    *   For `tf.data.Dataset` implementers: Added\n        `tf.data.Dataset._element_structured property` to replace\n        `Dataset.output_{types,shapes,classes}`.\n    *   Make `num_parallel_calls` of `tf.data.Dataset.interleave` and\n        `tf.data.Dataset.map` work in Eager mode.\n*   Toolchains\n    *   Fixed OpenSSL compatibility by avoiding `EVP_MD_CTX_destroy`.\n    *   Added bounds checking to printing deprecation warnings.\n    *   Upgraded CUDA dependency to 10.0\n    *   To build with Android NDK r14b, add \"#include <linux/compiler.h>\" to\n        android-ndk-r14b/platforms/android-14/arch-*/usr/include/linux/futex.h\n    *   Removed `:android_tensorflow_lib_selective_registration*` targets, use\n        `:android_tensorflow_lib_lite*` targets instead.\n*   XLA\n    *   Move `RoundToEven` function to xla/client/lib/math.h.\n    *   A new environment variable `TF_XLA_DEBUG_OPTIONS_PASSTHROUGH` set to \"1\"\n        or \"true\" allows the debug options passed within an XRTCompile op to be\n        passed directly to the XLA compilation backend. If such variable is not\n        set (service side), only a restricted set will be passed through.\n    *   Allow the XRTCompile op to return the ProgramShape resulted form the XLA\n        compilation as a second return argument.\n    *   XLA HLO graphs can now be rendered as SVG/HTML.\n*   Estimator\n    *   Replace all occurrences of `tf.contrib.estimator.BaselineEstimator` with\n        `tf.estimator.BaselineEstimator`\n    *   Replace all occurrences of\n        `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator` with\n        `tf.estimator.DNNLinearCombinedEstimator`\n    *   Replace all occurrences of `tf.contrib.estimator.DNNEstimator` with\n        `tf.estimator.DNNEstimator`\n    *   Replace all occurrences of `tf.contrib.estimator.LinearEstimator` with\n        `tf.estimator.LinearEstimator`\n    *   Users of `tf.contrib.estimator.export_all_saved_models` and related\n        should switch to\n        `tf.estimator.Estimator.experimental_export_all_saved_models`.\n    *   Update `regression_head` to the new Head API for Canned Estimator V2.\n    *   Switch `multi_class_head` to Head API for Canned Estimator V2.\n    *   Replace all occurrences of `tf.contrib.estimator.InMemoryEvaluatorHook`\n        and `tf.contrib.estimator.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook` with\n        `tf.estimator.experimental.InMemoryEvaluatorHook` and\n        `tf.estimator.experimental.make_stop_at_checkpoint_step_hook`\n    *   Migrate linear optimizer from contrib to core.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAbhinav Upadhyay, Ag Ramesh, akikaaa, Alexis Louis, Anders Huss, Andreas Madsen, Andrew Banchich, Andy Craze, Anton Dmitriev, Artem Malykh, Avijit-Nervana, Balint Cristian, Benjamin Tan Wei Hao, Bhavani Subramanian, Brendan Finan, Brian Nemsick, Bryan Cutler, By Shen, Cao Zongyan, Castiel, Chris Antaki, Christian Goll, Cibifang, Clayne Robison, Codrut Grosu, Cong Xu, Dalmo Cirne, Daniel Hunter, Dougal J.

Catching a ValueError\n        exception thrown by `tf.contrib.get_signature_def_by_key` should be\n        replaced by catching a KeyError exception.\n*   `tf.contrib.data`\n    *   Deprecate, and replace by tf.data.experimental.\n*   Other:\n    *   Instead of jemalloc, revert back to using system malloc since it\n        simplifies build and has comparable performance.\n    *   Remove integer types from `tf.nn.softplus` and `tf.nn.softsign` OpDefs.\n        This is a bugfix; these ops were never meant to support integers.\n    *   Allow subslicing Tensors with a single dimension.\n    *   Add option to calculate string length in Unicode characters.\n    *   Add functionality to SubSlice a tensor.\n    *   Add searchsorted (ie lower/upper_bound) op.\n    *   Add model explainability to Boosted Trees.\n    *   Support negative positions for tf.substr.\n    *   There was previously a bug in the bijector_impl where the\n        _reduce_jacobian_det_over_event does not handle scalar ILDJ\n        implementations properly.\n    *   In tf eager execution, allow re-entering a GradientTape context.\n    *   Add tf_api_version flag. If --define=tf_api_version=2 flag is passed in,\n        then bazel will build TensorFlow API version 2.0. Note that TensorFlow\n        2.0 is under active development and has no guarantees at this point.\n    *   Add additional compression options to TfRecordWriter.\n    *   Performance improvements for regex full match operations.\n    *   Replace tf.GraphKeys.VARIABLES with `tf.GraphKeys.GLOBAL_VARIABLES`.\n    *   Remove unused dynamic learning rate support.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n(David) Siu-Kei Muk, Ag Ramesh, Anton Dmitriev, Artem Sobolev, Avijit-Nervana,\nBairen Yi, Bruno Goncalves, By Shen, candy.dc, Cheng Chen, Clayne Robison,\ncoder3101, Dao Zhang, Elms, Fei Hu, feiquan, Geoffrey Irving, Guozhong Zhuang,\nhellcom, Hoeseong Kim, imsheridan, Jason Furmanek, Jason Zaman, Jenny Sahng,\njiefangxuanyan, Johannes Bannhofer, Jonathan Homer, Koan-Sin Tan, kouml, Loo\nRong Jie, Lukas Geiger, manipopopo, Ming Li, Moritz Kr\u00f6Ger, Naurril, Niranjan\nHasabnis, Pan Daoxin, Peng Yu, pengwa, rasmi, Roger Xin, Roland Fernandez, Sami\nKama, Samuel Matzek, Sangjung Woo, Sergei Lebedev, Sergii Khomenko, shaohua,\nShaohua Zhang, Shujian2015, Sunitha Kambhampati, tomguluson92, Vin\u00edCius Camargo,\nwangsiyu, weidankong, Wen-Heng (Jack) Chung, William D.

See updated install guides:\n        [Installing TensorFlow on Ubuntu](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#tensorflow_gpu_support)\n*   Google Cloud TPU:\n    *   Experimental tf.data integration for Keras on Google Cloud TPUs.\n    *   Experimental / preview support for eager execution on Google Cloud TPUs.\n*   DistributionStrategy:\n    *   Add multi-GPU DistributionStrategy support in tf.keras. Users can now\n        use `fit`, `evaluate` and `predict` to distribute their model on\n        multiple GPUs.\n    *   Add multi-worker DistributionStrategy and standalone client support in\n        Estimator. See\n        [README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/distribute)\n        for more details.\n*   Add C, C++, and Python functions for querying kernels.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n* Keras:\n  * The default values for tf.keras `RandomUniform`, `RandomNormal`, and `TruncatedNormal` initializers have been changed to match those in external Keras.\n  * Breaking change: `model.get_config()` on a Sequential model now returns a config dictionary (consistent with other Model instances) instead of a list of configs for the underlying layers.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   C++:\n    *   Changed the signature of SessionFactory::NewSession so that it can\n        return a meaningful error message on failure.\n*   tf.data:\n    *   Remove `num_parallel_parser_calls` argument from\n        `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset()`. [tf.data] Remove\n        `num_parallel_parser_calls` argument from\n        `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset()`.\n    *   `tf.data.Dataset.list_files()` raises an exception at initialization\n        time if the argument matches no files.\n    *   Renamed BigTable class to BigtableTable for clarity\n    *   Document use of the Cloud Bigtable API\n    *   Add `tf.contrib.data.reduce_dataset` which can be used to reduce a\n        dataset to a single element.\n    *   Generalization of `tf.contrib.data.sliding_window_batch`.\n*   INC:\n    *   Runtime improvements to triangular solve.\n*   `tf.contrib`:\n    *   Add an `implementation` argument to `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected2D`\n        and `tf.keras.layers.LocallyConnected1D`. The new mode\n        (`implementation=2`) performs forward pass as a single dense matrix\n        multiplication, allowing dramatic speedups in certain scenarios (but\n        worse performance in others - see docstring). The option also allows to\n        use `padding=same`.\n    *   Add documentation clarifying the differences between tf.fill and\n        tf.constant.\n    *   Add experimental IndexedDatasets.\n    *   Add selective registration target using the lite proto runtime.\n    *   Add simple Tensor and DataType classes to TensorFlow Lite Java\n    *   Add support for bitcasting to/from uint32 and uint64.\n    *   Added a subclass of Estimator that can be created from a SavedModel\n        (SavedModelEstimator).\n    *   Adds leaf index modes as an argument.\n    *   Allow a different output shape from the input in\n        tf.contrib.image.transform.\n    *   Change the state_size order of the StackedRNNCell to be natural order.\n        To keep the existing behavior, user can add reverse_state_order=True\n        when constructing the StackedRNNCells.\n    *   Deprecate self.test_session() in favor of self.session() or\n        self.cached_session().\n    *   Directly import tensor.proto.h (the transitive import will be removed\n        from tensor.h soon).\n    *   Estimator.train() now supports tf.contrib.summary.\\* summaries out of\n        the box; each call to .train() will now create a separate tfevents file\n        rather than re-using a shared one.\n    *   Fix FTRL L2-shrinkage behavior: the gradient from the L2 shrinkage term\n        should not end up in the accumulator.\n    *   Fix toco compilation/execution on Windows.\n    *   GoogleZoneProvider class added to detect which Google Cloud Engine zone\n        tensorflow is running in.\n    *   It is now safe to call any of the C API's TF_Delete\\* functions on\n        nullptr.\n    *   Log some errors on Android to logcat.\n    *   Match FakeQuant numerics in TFLite to improve accuracy of TFLite\n        quantized inference models.\n    *   Optional bucket location check for the GCS Filesystem.\n    *   Performance enhancements for StringSplitOp & StringSplitV2Op.\n    *   Performance improvements for regex replace operations.\n    *   TFRecordWriter now raises an error if .write() fails.\n    *   TPU: More helpful error messages in TPUClusterResolvers.\n    *   The legacy_init_op argument to SavedModelBuilder methods for adding\n        MetaGraphs has been deprecated. Please use the equivalent main_op\n        argument instead. As part of this, we now explicitly check for a single\n        main_op or legacy_init_op at the time of SavedModel building, whereas\n        the check on main_op was previously only done at load time.\n    *   The protocol used for Estimator training is now configurable in\n        RunConfig.\n    *   Triangular solve performance improvements.\n    *   Unify RNN cell interface between TF and Keras. Add new\n        get_initial_state() to Keras and TF RNN cell, which will use to replace\n        the existing zero_state() method.\n    *   Update initialization of variables in Keras.\n    *   Updates to \"constrained_optimization\" in tensorflow/contrib.\n    *   boosted trees: adding pruning mode.\n    *   tf.train.Checkpoint does not delete old checkpoints by default.\n    *   tfdbg: Limit the total disk space occupied by dumped tensor data to 100\n        GBytes.

No new binaries will be built for Windows.\n\n\n# Release 1.10.0\n\n## Major Features And Improvements\n\n* The `tf.lite` runtime now supports `complex64`.\n* Initial [Google Cloud Bigtable integration](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.10/tensorflow/contrib/bigtable) for `tf.data`.\n* Improved local run behavior in `tf.estimator.train_and_evaluate` which does not reload checkpoints for evaluation.\n* `RunConfig` now sets device_filters to restrict how workers and PS can communicate. This can speed up training and ensure clean shutdowns in some situations. But if you have jobs that require communication between workers, you will have to set custom session_options in your `RunConfig`.\n* Moved Distributions and Bijectors from `tf.contrib.distributions` to [Tensorflow Probability (TFP)](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability). `tf.contrib.distributions` is now deprecated and will be removed by the end of 2018.\n* Adding new endpoints for existing tensorflow symbols. These endpoints are going to be the preferred endpoints going forward and may replace some of the existing endpoints in the future. See below for the complete list. New symbols have been added to the following modules: [`tf.debugging`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/debugging), [`tf.dtypes`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/dtypes), [`tf.image`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/image), [`tf.io`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/io), [`tf.linalg`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/linalg), [`tf.manip`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/manip), [`tf.math`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/math), [`tf.quantization`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/quantization), [`tf.strings`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_docs/python/tf/strings)\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\n* Prebuilt binaries are now (as of TensorFlow 1.10) built against NCCL 2.2 and no longer include NCCL in the binary install. TensorFlow usage with multiple GPUs and NCCL requires upgrade to [NCCL 2.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl). See updated install guides: [TensorFlow GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) and [Build TensorFlow from source](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source).\n* Starting from TensorFlow 1.11, Windows builds will use Bazel. Therefore, we will drop official support for cmake.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n* `tf.data`:\n  * `tf.contrib.data.group_by_reducer()` is now available via the public API.\n  * `tf.contrib.data.choose_from_datasets()` is now available via the public API.\n  * Adding `drop_remainder` argument to `tf.data.Dataset.batch()` and `tf.data.Dataset.padded_batch()`, deprecating `tf.contrib.data.batch_and_drop_remainder()` and `tf.contrib.data.padded_batch_and_drop_remainder()`.\n* `tf.estimator`:\n  * `Estimator`s now use custom savers included in `EstimatorSpec` scaffolds for saving SavedModels during export.\n  * `EstimatorSpec` will now add a default prediction output for export if no `export_output` is provided, eliminating the need to explicitly include a `PredictOutput` object in the `model_fn` for simple use-cases.\n  * Support sparse_combiner in canned Linear Estimators.\n  * Added batch normalization to `DNNClassifier`, `DNNRegressor`, and `DNNEstimator`.\n  * Adding ranking support for boosted trees.\n  * Adding center bias option for boosted trees.\n* Add `synchronization` and `aggregation` args to get_variable(). These args will be used for distributed variables.\n* Add `synchronization` and `aggregation` args to the layer `add_weight()` API. These args will be used for distributed variables.\n* `tf.losses.*` do not add to the global collection when executing eagerly (to avoid leaking memory).\n* Support different summary and checkpoint directories in `tf.train.MonitoredTrainingSession()`.\n* Added IndRNN, IndyGRU, and IndyLSTM cells to `tf.contrib.rnn`.\n* Add safe static factory functions for SparseTensor and convert all CHECKs to DCHECKs. Using the constructor directly is unsafe and deprecated.\n* Make the Bigtable client connection pool configurable & increase the default # of connections for performance.\n* Added derivative of `tf.random_gamma` with respect to the alpha parameter.\n* Added derivative of `tf.igamma(a, x)` and `tf.igammac(a, x)` with respect to a.\n* Modified Bessel functions of order zero and one.\n* Add FillTriangular Bijector to create triangular matrices.\n* Added support for Type III DCT, and `tf.spectral.idct(type=2|3)`.\n* Correctly handle CuDNN RNN weight loaded when nest in `TimeDistributed`.\n* Adding per-element weight support for `WALSComputePartialLhsAndRhsOp`.\n* ZerosLike and OnesLike ops treated as constants by Graph Transform Tool.\n* Gamma distribution and the derived distributions (Beta, Dirichlet, Student's t, inverse Gamma) now fully reparameterized.\n* Java: Experimental wrapper classes to make graph generation easier.

[Try it](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/eager/python/examples/nmt_with_attention/nmt_with_attention.ipynb?linkId=53292082).\n* Adding support of core [feature columns](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/feature_columns) and [losses](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/losses) to [gradient boosted trees estimators](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/r1/boosted_trees).\n* The [python interface](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/lite)\n  for the [TFLite Optimizing Converter](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/toco/README.md)\n  has been expanded, and the command line interface (AKA: `toco`, `tflite_convert`) is once again\n  included in the standard `pip` installation.\n* Improved data-loading and text processing with:\n    * [`tf.decode_compressed`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/decode_compressed)\n    * [`tf.string_strip`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/string_strip)\n    * [`tf.strings.regex_full_match`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/strings/regex_full_match)\n* Added experimental support for new pre-made Estimators:\n  * [`tf.contrib.estimator.BaselineEstimator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/BaselineEstimator)\n  * [`tf.contrib.estimator.RNNClassifier`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/RNNEstimator)\n  * [`tf.contrib.estimator.RNNEstimator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/RNNClassifier)\n* The [distributions.Bijector](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/distributions/bijectors/Bijector)\n  API supports broadcasting for Bijectors with new API changes.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n  * If you're opening empty variable scopes; replace `variable_scope('', ...)` by\n    `variable_scope(tf.get_variable_scope(), ...)`.\n  * Headers used for building custom ops have been moved from site-packages/external into site-packages/tensorflow/include/external.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n*   `tfe.Network` is deprecated. Please inherit from `tf.keras.Model`.\n*   Layered variable names have changed in the following conditions:\n    *   Using `tf.keras.layers` with custom variable scopes.\n    *   Using `tf.layers` in a subclassed `tf.keras.Model` class. See\n        [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.9/api_docs/python/tf/layers)\n        for more details\n*   `tf.data`:\n    *   `Dataset.from_generator()` now accepts an `args` list, in order to\n        create nested generators.\n    *   `Dataset.list_files()` now produces deterministic results when\n        `shuffle=False` or a `seed` is passed.\n    *   `tf.contrib.data.sample_from_datasets()` and\n        `tf.contrib.data.choose_from_datasets()` make it easier to sample or\n        deterministically choose elements from multiple datasets.\n    *   `tf.contrib.data.make_csv_dataset()` now supports line breaks in quoted\n        strings, and two infrequently used arguments removed.\n    *   (C++) `DatasetBase::DebugString()` is now `const`.\n    *   (C++) `DatasetBase::MakeIterator()` has been renamed to\n        `DatasetBase::MakeIteratorInternal()`.\n    *   (C++) `IteratorBase::Initialize()` method was added to support raising\n        errors during iterator construction.\n*   Eager Execution:\n    *   Added the ability to pause recording operations for gradient computation\n        via `tf.GradientTape.stop_recording`.\n    *   Updated documentation, introductory notebooks.\n*   `tf.keras`:\n    *   Move Keras code out of _impl folder and remove API files.\n    *   `tf.keras.Model.save_weights` now saves in TensorFlow format by default.\n    *   Enable dataset iterators to be passed to `tf.keras.Model` training/eval\n        methods.\n*   TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg) CLI: fix an issue in which the TensorBoard\n    Debugger Plugin could not handle total source file size exceeding gRPC\n    message size limit (4 MB).\n*   `tf.contrib`:\n    *   `tf.contrib.framework.zero_initializer` supports ResourceVariable.\n    *   Adding \"constrained_optimization\" to tensorflow/contrib.\n*   Other:\n    *   Add GCS Configuration Ops.\n    *   Changing signature of `MakeIterator` to enable propagating error status.\n    *   KL divergence for two Dirichlet distributions.\n    *   More consistent GcsFileSystem behavior for certain reads past EOF.\n    *   Update benchmark for tf.scan to match ranges across eager and graph\n        modes.\n    *   Fixed bug in `tf.reduce_prod gradient` for complex dtypes.\n    *   Allow the use of '.' in variables (e.g. \"hparams.parse('a.b=1.0')\"),\n        which would previously raise an error. This will correspond to an\n        attribute name with an embedded '.' symbol (e.g. 'a.b'), which can only\n        be accessed indirectly (e.g. through getattr and setattr). To set this\n        up the user will first need to explicitly add the variable to the hparam\n        object (e.g. \"hparams.add_hparam(name='a.b', value=0.0)\").\n    *   Benchmark for tf.scan in graph and eager modes.\n    *   Added complex128 support to FFT, FFT2D, FFT3D, IFFT, IFFT2D, and IFFT3D.\n    *   Making ids unique in `nn.embedding_lookup_sparse`. This helps to reduce\n        RPC calls for looking up the embeddings when there are repeated ids in\n        the batch.\n    *   Support indicator column in boosted trees.\n    *   Prevent `tf.gradients()` from backpropagating through integer tensors.\n    *   LinearOperator[1D,2D,3D]Circulant added to `tensorflow.linalg`.\n    *   Conv3D, Conv3DBackpropInput, Conv3DBackpropFilter now supports\n        arbitrary.\n    *   Added `tf.train.Checkpoint` for reading/writing object-based\n        checkpoints.\n    *   Added LinearOperatorKronecker, a dense-free implementation of the\n        Kronecker Product.\n    *   Allow LinearOperator to broadcast.\n    *   SavedModelBuilder will now deduplicate asset names that point to files\n        with the same basename and the same contents. Note that this may result\n        in new asset files included in SavedModels in cases where assets with\n        the same name but different contents were previously overwriting each\n        other.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAbdullah Alrasheed, Achal Shah, Ad-530, ADiegoCAlonso, Aditya Yogi, Ag Ramesh, akindyakov, Andy Kernahan, Anya Petrova, Aurelien Geron, Ben, Ben Barsdell, Bhavani-Subramanian, braincodercn, Brett Koonce, Brian Nemsick, Brian Zier, Bryan Heden, candy.dc, cclauss, Clayne Robison, ctiijima, Dalmo Cirne, David Norman, David T.H.

This improves forward compatibility of the SavedModel.\n* FFT support added to XLA CPU/GPU.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* Documentation updates:\n  * Added a second version of Getting Started, which is aimed at ML\nnewcomers.\n  * Clarified documentation on `resize_images.align_corners` parameter.\n  * Additional documentation for TPUs.\n* Google Cloud Storage (GCS):\n  * Add client-side throttle.\n  * Add a `FlushCaches()` method to the FileSystem interface, with an implementation for GcsFileSystem.\n* Other:\n  * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.Kumaraswamy`.\n  * `RetryingFileSystem::FlushCaches()` calls the base FileSystem's `FlushCaches()`.\n  * Add `auto_correlation` to distributions.\n  * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.Autoregressive`.\n  * Add SeparableConv1D layer.\n  * Add convolutional Flipout layers.\n  * When both inputs of `tf.matmul` are bfloat16, it returns bfloat16, instead of float32.\n  * Added `tf.contrib.image.connected_components`.\n  * Add `tf.contrib.framework.CriticalSection` that allows atomic variable access.\n  * Output variance over trees predictions for classifications tasks.\n  * For `pt` and `eval` commands, allow writing tensor values to filesystem as numpy files.\n  * gRPC: Propagate truncated errors (instead of returning gRPC internal error).\n  * Augment `parallel_interleave` to support 2 kinds of prefetching.\n  * Improved XLA support for C64-related ops log, pow, atan2, tanh.\n  * Add probabilistic convolutional layers.\n\n## API Changes\n* Introducing `prepare_variance` boolean with default setting to False for backward compatibility.\n* Move `layers_dense_variational_impl.py` to `layers_dense_variational.py`.\n\n## Known Bugs\n* Using XLA:GPU with CUDA 9 and CUDA 9.1 results in garbage results and/or\n  `CUDA_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` failures.\n\n  Google discovered in mid-December 2017 that the PTX-to-SASS compiler in CUDA 9\n  and CUDA 9.1 sometimes does not properly compute the carry bit when\n  decomposing 64-bit address calculations with large offsets (e.g. `load [x +\n  large_constant]`) into 32-bit arithmetic in SASS.\n\n  As a result, these versions of `ptxas` miscompile most XLA programs which use\n  more than 4GB of temp memory.  This results in garbage results and/or\n  `CUDA_ERROR_ILLEGAL_ADDRESS` failures.\n\n  A fix in CUDA 9.1.121 is expected in late February 2018.  We do not expect a\n  fix for CUDA 9.0.x.  Until the fix is available, the only workaround is to\n  [downgrade](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) to CUDA 8.0.x\n  or disable XLA:GPU.\n\n  TensorFlow will print a warning if you use XLA:GPU with a known-bad version of\n  CUDA; see e00ba24c4038e7644da417ddc639169b6ea59122.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n4d55397500, Ag Ramesh, Aiden Scandella, Akimasa Kimura, Alex Rothberg, Allen Goodman,\namilioto, Andrei Costinescu, Andrei Nigmatulin, Anjum Sayed, Anthony Platanios,\nAnush Elangovan, Armando Fandango, Ashish Kumar Ram, Ashwini Shukla, Ben, Bhavani Subramanian,\nBrett Koonce, Carl Thom\u00e9, cclauss, Cesc, Changming Sun, Christoph Boeddeker, Clayne Robison,\nClemens Schulz, Clint (Woonhyuk Baek), codrut3, Cole Gerdemann, Colin Raffel, Daniel Trebbien,\nDaniel Ylitalo, Daniel Zhang, Daniyar, Darjan Salaj, Dave Maclachlan, David Norman, Dong--Jian,\ndongsamb, dssgsra, Edward H, eladweiss, elilienstein, Eric Lilienstein, error.d, Eunji Jeong, fanlu,\nFlorian Courtial, fo40225, Fred, Gregg Helt, Guozhong Zhuang, Hanchen Li, hsm207, hyunyoung2,\nImSheridan, Ishant Mrinal Haloi, Jacky Ko, Jay Young, Jean Flaherty, Jerome, JerrikEph, Jesse\nKinkead, jfaath, Jian Lin, jinghuangintel, Jiongyan Zhang, Joel Hestness, Joel Shor, Johnny Chan,\nJulian Niedermeier, Julian Wolff, JxKing, K-W-W, Karl Lessard, Kasper Marstal, Keiji Ariyama,\nKoan-Sin Tan, Loki Der Quaeler, Loo Rong Jie, Luke Schaefer, Lynn Jackson, ManHyuk, Matt Basta,\nMatt Smith, Matthew Schulkind, Michael, michaelkhan3, Miguel Piedrafita, Mikalai Drabovich,\nMike Knapp, mjwen, mktozk, Mohamed Aly, Mohammad Ashraf Bhuiyan, Myungjoo Ham, Naman Bhalla,\nNamrata-Ibm, Nathan Luehr, nathansilberman, Netzeband, Niranjan Hasabnis, Omar Aflak, Ozge\nYalcinkaya, Parth P Panchal, patrickzzy, Patryk Chrabaszcz, Paul Van Eck, Pawe\u0142 Kapica, Peng Yu,\nPhilip Yang, Pierre Blondeau, Po-Hsien Chu, powderluv, Puyu Wang, Rajendra Arora, Rasmus, Renat\nIdrisov, resec, Robin Richtsfeld, Ronald Eddy Jr, Sahil Singh, Sam Matzek, Sami Kama, sandipmgiri,\nSantiago Castro, Sayed Hadi Hashemi, Scott Tseng, Sergii Khomenko, Shahid, Shengpeng Liu, Shreyash\nSharma, Shrinidhi Kl, Simone Cirillo, simsicon, Stanislav Levental, starsblinking, Stephen Lumenta,\nSteven Hickson, Su Tang, Taehoon Lee, Takuya Wakisaka, Ted Chang, Ted Ying, Tijmen Verhulsdonck,\nTimofey Kondrashov, vade, vaibhav, Valentin Khrulkov, vchigrin, Victor Costan, Viraj Navkal,\nVivek Rane, wagonhelm, Yan Facai (\u989c\u53d1\u624d), Yanbo Liang, Yaroslav Bulatov, yegord, Yong Tang,\nYoni Tsafir, yordun, Yuan (Terry) Tang, Yuxin Wu, zhengdi, Zhengsheng Wei, \u7530\u4f20\u6b66\n\n# Release 1.5.0\n\n## Breaking Changes\n* Prebuilt binaries are now built against CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7.\n* Starting from 1.6 release, our prebuilt binaries will use AVX instructions.\n  This may break TF on older CPUs.\n\n## Major Features And Improvements\n* [Eager execution](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.5/tensorflow/contrib/eager)\n  preview version is now available.\n* [TensorFlow Lite](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.5/tensorflow/lite)\n  dev preview is now available.\n* CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7 support.\n* Accelerated Linear Algebra (XLA):\n  * Add `complex64` support to XLA compiler.\n  * `bfloat` support is now added to XLA infrastructure.\n  * Make `ClusterSpec` propagation work with XLA devices.\n  * Use a deterministic executor to generate XLA graph.\n* `tf.contrib`:\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions`:\n    * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.Autoregressive`.\n    * Make `tf.contrib.distributions` QuadratureCompound classes support batch\n    * Infer `tf.contrib.distributions.RelaxedOneHotCategorical` `dtype` from arguments.\n    * Make `tf.contrib.distributions` quadrature family parameterized by\n      `quadrature_grid_and_prob` vs `quadrature_degree`.\n    * `auto_correlation` added to `tf.contrib.distributions`\n  * Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.layers`, a collection of probabilistic (neural) layers.\n  * Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.halton_sequence`.\n  * Add `tf.contrib.data.make_saveable_from_iterator.`\n  * Add `tf.contrib.data.shuffle_and_repeat`.\n  * Add new custom transformation: `tf.contrib.data.scan()`.\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors`:\n    * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors.MaskedAutoregressiveFlow`.\n    * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors.Permute`.\n    * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors.Gumbel`.\n    * Add `tf.contrib.distributions.bijectors.Reshape`.\n    * Support shape inference (i.e., shapes containing -1) in the Reshape bijector.\n* Add `streaming_precision_recall_at_equal_thresholds,` a method for computing\n  streaming precision and recall with `O(num_thresholds + size of predictions)`\n  time and space complexity.\n* Change `RunConfig` default behavior to not set a random seed, making random\n  behavior independently random on distributed workers. We expect this to\n  generally improve training performance. Models that do rely on determinism\n  should set a random seed explicitly.\n* Replaced the implementation of `tf.flags` with `absl.flags`.\n* Add support for `CUBLAS_TENSOR_OP_MATH` in fp16 GEMM\n* Add support for CUDA on NVIDIA Tegra devices\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* Documentation updates:\n  * Clarified that you can only install TensorFlow on 64-bit machines.\n  * Added a short doc explaining how `Estimator`s save checkpoints.\n  * Add documentation for ops supported by the `tf2xla` bridge.\n  * Fix minor typos in the doc of `SpaceToDepth` and `DepthToSpace`.\n  * Updated documentation comments in `mfcc_mel_filterbank.h` and `mfcc.h` to\n    clarify that the input domain is squared magnitude spectra and the weighting\n    is done on linear magnitude spectra (sqrt of inputs).\n  * Change `tf.contrib.distributions` docstring examples to use `tfd` alias\n    rather than `ds`, `bs`.\n  * Fix docstring typos in `tf.distributions.bijectors.Bijector`.\n  * `tf.assert_equal` no longer raises `ValueError.` It now raises\n    `InvalidArgumentError,` as documented.\n  * Update Getting Started docs and API intro.\n* Google Cloud Storage (GCS):\n  * Add userspace DNS caching for the GCS client.\n  * Customize request timeouts for the GCS filesystem.\n  * Improve GCS filesystem caching.\n* Bug Fixes:\n  * Fix bug where partitioned integer variables got their wrong shapes. Before\n  * Fix correctness bug in CPU and GPU implementations of Adadelta.\n  * Fix a bug in `import_meta_graph`'s handling of partitioned variables when\n    importing into a scope.

See\n    [Debugging TensorFlow Programs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/debugger)\n    for more details.\n  * Usability improvement: The frequently used tensor filter `has_inf_or_nan` is\n    now added to `Session` wrappers and hooks by default. So there is no need\n    for clients to call `.add_tensor_filter(tf_debug.has_inf_or_nan)` anymore.\n* SinhArcsinh (scalar) distribution added to `contrib.distributions`.\n* Make `GANEstimator` opensource.\n* `Estimator.export_savedmodel()` now includes all valid serving signatures\n  that can be constructed from the Serving Input Receiver and all available\n  ExportOutputs. For instance, a classifier may provide regression- and\n  prediction-flavored outputs, in addition to the classification-flavored one.\n  Building signatures from these allows TF Serving to honor requests using the\n  different APIs (Classify, Regress, and Predict). Furthermore,\n  `serving_input_receiver_fn()` may now specify alternative subsets of nodes\n  that may act as inputs. This allows, for instance, producing a prediction\n  signature for a classifier that accepts raw `Tensors` instead of a serialized\n  `tf.Example`.\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.hmc`.\n* Add `tf.contrib.distributions.MixtureSameFamily`.\n* Make `Dataset.shuffle()` always reshuffles after each iteration by default.\n* Add `tf.contrib.bayesflow.metropolis_hastings`.\n* Add `log_rate` parameter to `tf.contrib.distributions.Poisson`.\n* Extend `tf.contrib.distributions.bijector` API to handle some non-injective\n  transforms.\n* Java:\n  * Generics (e.g., `Tensor<Integer>`) for improved type-safety\n    (courtesy @andrewcmyers).\n  * Support for multi-dimensional string tensors.\n  * Support loading of custom operations (e.g. many in `tf.contrib`) on Linux\n    and OS X\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with CUDA 8 and cuDNN 6.\n  We anticipate releasing TensorFlow 1.5 with CUDA 9 and cuDNN 7.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* `tf.nn.rnn_cell.DropoutWrapper` is now more careful about dropping out LSTM\n  states.  Specifically, it no longer ever drops the `c` (memory) state of an\n  `LSTMStateTuple`.  The new behavior leads to proper dropout behavior\n  for LSTMs and stacked LSTMs.  This bug fix follows recommendations from\n  published literature, but is a behavioral change.  State dropout behavior\n  may be customized via the new `dropout_state_filter_visitor` argument.\n* Removed `tf.contrib.training.python_input`.  The same behavior, in a more\n  flexible and reproducible package, is available via the new\n  `tf.contrib.data.Dataset.from_generator` method!\n* Fix `tf.contrib.distributions.Affine` incorrectly computing log-det-jacobian.\n* Fix `tf.random_gamma` incorrectly handling non-batch, scalar draws.\n* Resolved a race condition in TensorForest TreePredictionsV4Op.\n* Google Cloud Storage file system, Amazon S3 file system, and Hadoop file\n  system support are now default build options.\n* Custom op libraries must link against libtensorflow_framework.so\n  (installed at `tf.sysconfig.get_lib()`).\n* Change `RunConfig` default behavior to not set a random seed, making random\n  behavior independently random on distributed workers. We expect this to\n  generally improve training performance. Models that do rely on determinism\n  should set a random seed explicitly.\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n* The signature of the `tf.contrib.data.rejection_resample()` function has been\n  changed. It now returns a function that can be used as an argument to\n  `Dataset.apply()`.\n* Remove `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.from_dataset()` method. Use\n  `Dataset.make_initializable_iterator()` instead.\n* Remove seldom used and unnecessary `tf.contrib.data.Iterator.dispose_op()`.\n* Reorder some TF-GAN loss functions in a non-backwards compatible way.\n\n## Known Issues\n* In Python 3, `Dataset.from_generator()` does not support Unicode strings.\n  You must convert any strings to bytes objects before yielding them from\n  the generator.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n4d55397500, Abdullah Alrasheed, abenmao, Adam Salvail, Aditya Dhulipala, Ag Ramesh,\nAkimasa Kimura, Alan Du, Alan Yee, Alexander, Amit Kushwaha, Amy, Andrei Costinescu,\nAndrei Nigmatulin, Andrew Erlichson, Andrew Myers, Andrew Stepanov, Androbin, AngryPowman,\nAnish Shah, Anton Daitche, Artsiom Chapialiou, asdf2014, Aseem Raj Baranwal, Ash Hall,\nBart Kiers, Batchu Venkat Vishal, ben, Ben Barsdell, Bill Piel, Carl Thom\u00e9, Catalin Voss,\nChangming Sun, Chengzhi Chen, Chi Zeng, Chris Antaki, Chris Donahue, Chris Oelmueller,\nChris Tava, Clayne Robison, Codrut, Courtial Florian, Dalmo Cirne, Dan J, Darren Garvey,\nDavid Kristoffersson, David Norman, David R\u00f6Thlisberger, DavidNorman, Dhruv, DimanNe,\nDorokhov, Duncan Mac-Vicar P, EdwardDixon, EMCP, error.d, FAIJUL, Fan Xia,\nFrancois Xavier, Fred Reiss, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang,\nGuenther Schmuelling, Guo Yejun (\u90ed\u53f6\u519b), Hans Gaiser, HectorSVC, Hyungsuk Yoon,\nJames Pruegsanusak, Jay Young, Jean Wanka, Jeff Carpenter, Jeremy Rutman, Jeroen B\u00e9Dorf,\nJett Jones, Jimmy Jia, jinghuangintel, jinze1994, JKurland, Joel Hestness, joetoth,\nJohn B Nelson, John Impallomeni, John Lawson, Jonas, Jonathan Dekhtiar, joshkyh, Jun Luan,\nJun Mei, Kai Sasaki, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kb Sriram, Kenichi Ueno, Kevin Slagle,\nKongsea, Lakshay Garg, lhlmgr, Lin Min, liu.guangcong, Loki Der Quaeler, Louie Helm,\nlucasmoura, Luke Iwanski, Lyndon White, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Puyat, Mark Aaron Shirley,\nMichele Colombo, MtDersvan, Namrata-Ibm, Nathan Luehr, Naurril, Nayana Thorat, Nicolas Lopez,\nNiranjan Hasabnis, Nolan Liu, Nouce, Oliver Hennigh, osdamv, Patrik Erdes,\nPatryk Chrabaszcz, Pavel Christof, Penghao Cen, postBG, Qingqing Cao, Qingying Chen, qjivy,\nRaphael, Rasmi, raymondxyang, Renze Yu, resec, Roffel, Ruben Vereecken, Ryohei Kuroki,\nsandipmgiri, Santiago Castro, Scott Kirkland, Sean Vig, Sebastian Raschka, Sebastian Weiss,\nSergey Kolesnikov, Sergii Khomenko, Shahid, Shivam Kotwalia, Stuart Berg, Sumit Gouthaman,\nsuperzerg, Sven Mayer, tetris, Ti Zhou, Tiago Freitas Pereira, Tian Jin, Tomoaki Oiki,\nVaibhav Sood, vfdev, Vivek Rane, Vladimir Moskva, wangqr, Weber Xie, Will Frey,\nYan Facai (\u989c\u53d1\u624d), yanivbl6, Yaroslav Bulatov, Yixing Lao, Yong Tang, youkaichao,\nYuan (Terry) Tang, Yue Zhang, Yuxin Wu, Ziming Dong, ZxYuan, \u9ec4\u749e\n\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.\n\n# Release 1.3.0\n\nSee also [TensorBoard 0.1.4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/releases/tag/0.1.4) release notes.\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n* Added canned estimators to Tensorflow library. List of added estimators:\n  * `DNNClassifier`\n  * `DNNRegressor`\n  * `LinearClassifier`\n  * `LinearRegressor`\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedClassifier`\n  * `DNNLinearCombinedRegressor`.\n* All our prebuilt binaries have been built with cuDNN 6. We anticipate releasing TensorFlow 1.4 with cuDNN 7.\n* `import tensorflow` now goes much faster.\n* Adds a file cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable max staleness for file contents. This permits caching of file contents across close/open boundaries.\n* Added an axis parameter to `tf.gather`.\n* Added a `constant_values` keyword argument to `tf.pad`.\n* Adds `Dataset.interleave` transformation.\n* Add `ConcatenateDataset` to concatenate two datasets.\n* Added Mobilenet support to TensorFlow for Poets training script.\n* Adds a block cache to the GCS filesystem with configurable block size and count.\n* SinhArcSinh bijector added.\n* Added `Dataset.list_files` API.\n* Introduces new operations and Python bindings for the Cloud TPU.\n* Adding TensorFlow-iOS CocoaPod for symmetry with tensorflow-android.\n* Introduces base implementations of ClusterResolvers.\n* Unify memory representations of TensorShape and PartialTensorShape. As a consequence, tensors now have a maximum of 254 dimensions, not 255.\n* Changed references to LIBXSMM to use version 1.8.1.\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\n  * Display summaries of numeric tensor values with the `-s` flag to command `print_tensor` or `pt`.\n  * Display feed values with the `print_feed` or `pf` command and clickable links in the curses UI.\n  * Runtime profiler at the op level and the Python source line level with the `run -p` command.\n* Initial release of the statistical distribution library `tf.distributions`.\n* GPU kernels and speed improvements for unary `tf.where` and `tf.nn.top_k`.\n* Monotonic Attention wrappers added to `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\n* Added `tf.contrib.signal`, a library for signal processing primitives.\n* Added `tf.contrib.resampler`, containing CPU and GPU ops for differentiable resampling of images.\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n* `tf.RewriterConfig` was removed from the Python API after being available in 1.2 release candidates (it was never in an actual release). Graph rewriting is still available, just not as `tf.RewriterConfig`. Instead add an explicit import.\n* Breaking change to `tf.contrib.data.Dataset` APIs that expect a nested structure. Lists are now converted to `tf.Tensor` implicitly. You may need to change uses of lists to tuples in existing code. In addition, dicts are now supported as a nested structure.\n\n## Changes to contrib APIs\n* Adds tf.contrib.nn.rank_sampled_softmax_loss, a sampled-softmax variant that can improve rank loss.\n* `tf.contrib.metrics`.{streaming_covariance,streaming_pearson_correlation} modified to return nan when they have seen less or equal to 1 unit of weight.\n* Adds time series models to contrib. See contrib/timeseries/README.md for details.\n* Adds FULLY_CONNECTED Op to tensorflow/lite/schema.fbs\n\n## Known Issues\n* Tensorflow_gpu compilation fails with Bazel 0.5.3.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* Fixes `strides` and `begin` dtype mismatch when slicing using int64 Tensor index in python.\n* Improved convolution padding documentation.\n* Add a tag constant, gpu, to present graph with GPU support.\n* `saved_model.utils` now support SparseTensors transparently.\n* A more efficient implementation of non-max suppression.\n* Add support for the shrinkage-type L2 to FtrlOptimizer in addition to the online L2 it already supports.\n* Fix negative variance in moments calculation.\n* Expand UniqueOp Benchmark Tests to cover more collision cases.\n* Improves stability of GCS filesystem on Mac.\n* Add time estimation to HloCostAnalysis.\n* Fixed the bug in Estimator that params in constructor was not a deepcopy of the user provided one. This bugs inadvertently enabled user to mutate the params after the creation of Estimator, leading to potentially undefined behavior.\n* Added None check for save_path in `saver.restore`.\n* Register devices under their legacy names in device_mgr to ease the transition to clusterspec-propagated configurations.\n* VectorExponential added to distributions.\n* Add a bitwise module with bitwise_and, bitwise_or, bitwise_xor, and invert functions.\n* Add fixed-grid ODE integration routines.\n* Allow passing bounds to ScipyOptimizerInterface.\n* Correctness fixes for fft_length parameter to `tf.spectral.rfft` & `tf.spectral.irfft`.\n* Exported model signatures using the 'predict' method will no longer have their input and output keys silently ignored and rewritten to 'inputs' and 'outputs'. If a model was exported with different names before 1.2, and is now served with tensorflow/serving, it will accept requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs'. Starting at 1.2, such a model will accept the keys specified during export. Therefore, inference requests using 'inputs' and 'outputs' may start to fail. To fix this, either update any inference clients to send requests with the actual input and output keys used by the trainer code, or conversely, update the trainer code to name the input and output Tensors 'inputs' and 'outputs', respectively. Signatures using the 'classify' and 'regress' methods are not affected by this change; they will continue to standardize their input and output keys as before.\n* Add in-memory caching to the Dataset API.\n* Set default end_of_sequence variable in datasets iterators to false.\n* [Performance] Increase performance of `tf.layers.conv2d` when setting use_bias=True by 2x by using nn.bias_add.\n* Update iOS examples to use CocoaPods, and moved to tensorflow/examples/ios.\n* Adds a family= attribute in `tf.summary` ops to allow controlling the tab name used in Tensorboard for organizing summaries.\n* When GPU is configured, do not require --config=cuda, instead, automatically build for GPU if this is requested in the configure script.\n* Fix incorrect sampling of small probabilities in CPU/GPU multinomial.\n* Add a list_devices() API on sessions to list devices within a cluster. Additionally, this change augment the ListDevices master API to support specifying a session.\n* Allow uses of over-parameterized separable convolution.\n* TensorForest multi-regression bug fix.\n* Framework now supports armv7, cocoapods.org now displays correct page.\n* Script to create iOS framework for CocoaPods.\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier integration into apps. See https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/android/inference_interface/README.md for more details.\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from functioning with multi-GPU setups.\n  * Fixed a bug that prevented tfdbg from working with `tf.Session.make_callable`.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n4F2E4A2E, Adriano Carmezim, Adri\u00e0 Arrufat, Alan Yee, Alex Lattas, Alex Rothberg,\nAlexandr Baranezky, Ali Siddiqui, Andreas Solleder, Andrei Costinescu, Andrew Hundt,\nAndrobin, Andy Kernahan, Anish Shah, Anthony Platanios, Arvinds-Ds, b1rd, Baptiste\nArnaud, Ben Mabey, Benedikt Linse, Beomsu Kim, Bo Wang, Boyuan Deng, Brett Koonce,\nBruno Rosa, Carl Thom\u00e9, Changming Sun, Chase Roberts, Chirag Bhatia, Chris Antaki,\nChris Hoyean Song, Chris Tava, Christos Nikolaou, Croath Liu, cxx, Czxck001, Daniel\nYlitalo, Danny Goodman, Darren Garvey, David Brailovsky, David Norman, DavidNorman,\ndavidpham87, ddurham2, Dhruv, DimanNe, Drew Hintz, Dustin Tran, Earthson Lu, ethiraj,\nFabian Winnen, Fei Sun, Freedom\" Koan-Sin Tan, Fritz Obermeyer, Gao, Xiang, Gautam,\nGuenther Schmuelling, Gyu-Ho Lee, Hauke Brammer, horance, Humanity123, J Alammar,\nJayeol Chun, Jeroen B\u00e9Dorf, Jianfei Wang, jiefangxuanyan, Jing Jun Yin, Joan Puigcerver,\nJoel Hestness, Johannes Mayer, John Lawson, Johnson145, Jon Malmaud, Jonathan Alvarez-Gutierrez,\nJuang, Yi-Lin, Julian Viereck, Kaarthik Sivashanmugam, Karl Lessard, karl@kubx.ca, Kevin\nCarbone, Kevin Van Der Burgt, Kongsea, ksellesk, lanhin, Lef Ioannidis, Liangliang He,\nLouis Tiao, Luke Iwanski, L\u00e1Szl\u00f3 Csomor, magixsno, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Marcel Hlopko, Mark\nNeumann, Maxwell Paul Brickner, mdfaijul, Micha\u00ebL Defferrard, Micha\u0142 Jastrz\u0119Bski, Michele\nColombo, Mike Brodie, Mosnoi Ion, mouradmourafiq, myPrecious, Nayana Thorat,\nNeeraj Kashyap, Nelson Liu, Niranjan Hasabnis, Olivier Moindrot, orome, Pankaj Gupta, Paul\nVan Eck, peeyush18, Peng Yu, Pierre, preciousdp11, qjivy, Raingo, raoqiyu, ribx, Richard S.\nImaoka, Rishabh Patel, Robert Walecki, Rockford Wei, Ryan Kung, Sahil Dua, Sandip Giri, Sayed\nHadi Hashemi, sgt101, Shitian Ni, Shuolongbj, Siim P\u00f5Der, Simon Perkins, sj6077, SOLARIS,\nSpotlight0xff, Steffen Eberbach, Stephen Fox, superryanguo, Sven Mayer, Tapan Prakash,\nTiago Morais Morgado, Till Hoffmann, Tj Rana, Vadim Markovtsev, vhasanov, Wei Wu,\nwindead, Yan (Asta) Li, Yan Chen, Yann Henon, Yi Wang, Yong Tang, yorkie, Yuan (Terry)\nTang, Yuxin Wu, zhengjiajin, zhongzyd, \u9ec4\u749e\n\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.\n\n# Release 1.2.1\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* Updating markdown version required to >= 2.6.8.\n* Support tensors as dropout rates again, by removing the min(max(..))\n\n# Release 1.2.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n* Python 3.6 support on Windows.\n* Added `tf.layers.conv3d_transpose` layer for spatio temporal deconvolution.\n* Added `tf.Session.make_callable()`, which provides a lower overhead means of running a similar step multiple times.\n* Added libverbs-based RDMA support to contrib (courtesy @junshi15 from Yahoo).\n* Bring `tf.feature_column.*` into the API. Non-deprecated functionality from `tf.contrib.layers.*` is moved to `tf.feature_column.*` with cosmetic changes.\n* `RNNCell` objects now subclass `tf.layers.Layer`.  The strictness described\n  in the TensorFlow 1.1 release is gone:  The first time an RNNCell is used,\n  it caches its scope.  All future uses of the RNNCell will reuse variables from\n  that same scope.  This is a breaking change from the behavior of RNNCells\n  in TensorFlow versions <= 1.0.1.  TensorFlow 1.1 had checks in place to\n  ensure old code works correctly with the new semantics; this version\n  allows more flexible uses of RNNCell but can lead to subtle errors if\n  using code meant for TensorFlow <= 1.0.1.  For example, writing:\n  `MultiRNNCell([lstm] * 5)` will now build a 5-layer LSTM stack where each\n  layer shares the **same** parameters.  To get 5 layers each with their own\n  parameters, write: `MultiRNNCell([LSTMCell(...) for _ in range(5)])`.\n  If at all unsure, first test your code with TF 1.1; ensure it raises no\n  errors, and then upgrade to TF 1.2.\n* RNNCells' variable names have been renamed for consistency with Keras layers.\n  Specifically, the previous variable names \"weights\" and \"biases\" have\n  been changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the tool\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\n* Many of the RNN functions and classes that were in the `tf.nn` namespace\n  before the 1.0 release and which were moved to `tf.contrib.rnn` have now\n  been moved back to the core namespace.  This includes\n  `RNNCell`, `LSTMCell`, `GRUCell`, and a number of other cells.  These\n  now reside in `tf.nn.rnn_cell` (with aliases in `tf.contrib.rnn` for backwards\n  compatibility).  The original `tf.nn.rnn` function is now `tf.nn.static_rnn`,\n  and the bidirectional static and state saving static rnn functions are also\n  now back in the `tf.nn` namespace.\n\n  Notable exceptions are the `EmbeddingWrapper`, `InputProjectionWrapper` and\n  `OutputProjectionWrapper`,  which will slowly be moved to deprecation\n  in `tf.contrib.rnn`.  These are inefficient wrappers that should often\n  be replaced by calling `embedding_lookup` or `layers.dense` as pre- or post-\n  processing of the rnn.  For RNN decoding, this functionality has been replaced\n  with an alternative API in `tf.contrib.seq2seq`.\n* Intel MKL Integration (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/tensorflow-optimizations-on-modern-intel-architecture). Intel developed a number of\n  optimized deep learning primitives: In addition to matrix multiplication and\n  convolution, these building blocks include:\n  Direct batched convolution\n  Pooling: maximum, minimum, average\n  Normalization: LRN, batch normalization\n  Activation: rectified linear unit (ReLU)\n  Data manipulation: multi-dimensional transposition (conversion), split,\n  concat, sum and scale.\n* TensorForest Estimator now supports SavedModel export for serving.\n* Support client-provided ClusterSpec's and propagate them to all workers to enable the creation of dynamic TensorFlow clusters.\n* TensorFlow C library now available for Windows.\n* We released a new open-source version of TensorBoard.\n* [`SavedModel CLI`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/guide/saved_model_cli) tool available to inspect and execute MetaGraph in SavedModel\n* Android releases of TensorFlow are now pushed to jcenter for easier\n  integration into apps. See\n  https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/tools/android/inference_interface/README.md\n  for more details.\n\n## Deprecations\n\n* TensorFlow 1.2 may be the last time we build with cuDNN 5.1. Starting with\n  TensorFlow 1.3, we will try to build all our prebuilt binaries with cuDNN 6.0.\n  While we will try to keep our source code compatible with cuDNN 5.1, it will\n  be best effort.\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n* `org.tensorflow.contrib.android.TensorFlowInferenceInterface` now throws exceptions where possible and has simplified method signatures.\n\n## Changes to contrib APIs\n* Added `tf.contrib.util.create_example`.\n* Added bilinear interpolation to `tf.contrib.image`.\n* Add `tf.contrib.stateless` for random ops with custom seed control.\n* MultivariateNormalFullCovariance added to contrib/distributions/\n* tensorflow/contrib/rnn undergoes RNN cell variable renaming for\n  consistency with Keras layers. Specifically, the previous variable names\n  \"weights\" and \"biases\" are changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\n  This may cause backward incompatibility with regard to your old\n  checkpoints containing such RNN cells, in which case you can use the\n  [checkpoint_convert script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/contrib/rnn/python/tools/checkpoint_convert.py)\n  to convert the variable names in your old checkpoints.\n* Added `tf.contrib.kernel_methods` module with Ops and estimators for primal\n  (explicit) kernel methods in TensorFlow.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* In python, `Operation.get_attr` on type attributes returns the Python DType\n  version of the type to match expected get_attr documentation rather than the\n  protobuf enum.\n* tensorflow/contrib/rnn undergoes RNN cell variable renaming for\n  consistency with Keras layers. Specifically, the previous variable names\n  \"weights\" and \"biases\" are changed to \"kernel\" and \"bias\", respectively.\n* Changed MIN_SDK version to 8.0 when building iOS libraries.\n* Fixed LIBXSMM integration.\n* Make decode_jpeg/decode_png/decode_gif handle all formats, since users frequently try to decode an image as the wrong type.\n* Improve implicit broadcasting lowering.\n* Improving stability of GCS/BigQuery clients by a faster retrying of stale transmissions.\n* Remove OpKernelConstruction::op_def() as part of minimizing proto dependencies.\n* VectorLaplaceDiag distribution added.\n* Android demo no longer requires libtensorflow_demo.so to run (libtensorflow_inference.so still required)\n* Added `categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file`.\n* Introduce ops for batching/unbatching tensors across Session::Run() calls.\n* Add tf.log_sigmoid(x) = tf.log(tf.sigmoid(x)) = -tf.nn.softplus(-x).\n* Changed hooks lists to immutable tuples, and now allow any iterable for the associated arguments.\n* Introduce TFDecorator.\n* Added an Mfcc op for speech feature generation.\n* Improved DirectSession::Run() overhead and error checking. Feeding a value of the wrong type will now synchronously raise an INVALID_ARGUMENT error instead of asynchronously raising an INTERNAL error. Code that depends on the (undefined) behavior when feeding a tensor of the wrong type may need to be updated.\n* Added unreduced NONE, and reduced MEAN options for losses. Removed \"WEIGHTED_\" prefix from other Reduction constants.\n* assertAllClose now handles dicts.\n* Added Gmock matcher for HloInstructions.\n* Add var name to errors on variable restore.\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\n* Added `reduction` arg to losses.\n* `tf.placeholder` can represent scalar shapes and partially known.\n* Remove estimator_spec(mode) argument.\n* Added an AudioSpectrogram op for audio feature generation.\n* TensorBoard disables all runs by default if there are more than 40 runs.\n* Removed old doc generator code.\n* GCS file system integration now supports domain buckets, e.g gs://bucket.domain.com/path.\n* Add `tf.summary.text` for outputting text to TensorBoard.\n* The \"run\" command of tfdbg's command-line interface now supports filtering of tensors by node name, op type and tensor dtype.\n* `tf.string_to_number` now supports int64 and float64 outputs.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n4F2E4A2E, Aaron Schumacher, Abhi Agg, admcrae, Adriano Carmezim, Adri\u00e0 Arrufat,\nagramesh1, Akimitsu Seo, Alan Mosca, Alex Egg, Alex Rothberg, Alexander Heinecke,\nAlexander Matyasko, Alexandr Baranezky, Alexandre Caulier, Ali Siddiqui, Anand Venkat,\nAndrew Hundt, Androbin, Anmol Sharma, Arie, Arno Leist, Arron Cao, Aur\u00e9Lien Geron, Bairen Yi,\nBeomsu Kim, Carl Thom\u00e9, cfperez, Changming Sun, Corey Wharton, critiqjo, Dalei Li, Daniel\nRasmussen, Daniel Trebbien, Dar\u00edO Here\u00f1\u00fa, David Eng, David Norman, David Y.

Moved existing FFT ops to `tf.spectral` while\n  keeping an alias in the old location (`tf.*`).\n* Added 1D, 2D and 3D Fourier transform ops for real signals to `tf.spectral`.\n* Added a `tf.bincount` function.\n* Added Keras 2 API to contrib.\n* Added a new lightweight queue-like object - `RecordInput`.\n* Added `tf.contrib.image.compose_transforms` function.\n* Bring `tf.estimator.*` into the API. Non-deprecated functionality from `tf.contrib.learn.Estimator` is moved to `tf.estimator.Estimator` with cosmetic changes.\n* Docker images: TF images on gcr.io and Docker Hub are upgraded to ubuntu:16.04.\n* Added the following features to TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg):\n  * Ability to inspect Python source file against TF ops and tensors (command `print_source` / `ps`)\n  * New navigation bar in Curses-based UI\n  * NodeStepper (command `invoke_stepper`) now uses intermediate tensor dumps. It also uses `TensorHandles` as direct feeds during successive `cont` calls for improved performance and reduced memory consumption.\n* Initial release of installation guides for Java, C, and Go.\n* Added Text Dashboard to TensorBoard.\n\n## Deprecations\n\n* TensorFlow 1.1.0 will be the last time we release a binary with Mac GPU support. Going forward, we will stop testing on Mac GPU systems. We continue to welcome patches that maintain Mac GPU support, and we will try to keep the Mac GPU build working.\n\n## Changes to contrib APIs\n* The behavior of RNNCells is now stricter due to the transition towards making RNNCells act more like Keras layers.\n  * If an RNNCell is used twice in two different variable scopes, an error is raised describing how to avoid this behavior.\n  * If an RNNCell is used in a variable scope with existing conflicting variables, an error is raised showing that the RNNCell must be constructed with argument `reuse=True`.\n* Deprecated contrib/distributions `pmf`, `pdf`, `log_pmf`, `log_pdf`.\n* Moved `bayesflow.special_math` to distributions.\n* `tf.contrib.tensor_forest.python.tensor_forest.RandomForestDeviceAssigner` removed.\n* Changed some MVN classes and parameters:\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalFull` replaced by `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalTriL`.\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalCholesky` replaced by `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalTriL`\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiagWithSoftplusStDev` replaced\n    by `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiagWithSoftplusScale`\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiag` arguments changed from `mu`, `diag_stddev` to `log`, `scale_diag`.\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiagPlusVDVT` removed.\n  * `tf.contrib.distributions.MultivariateNormalDiagPlusLowRank` added.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* Java: Support for loading models exported using the SavedModel API (courtesy @EronWright).\n* Go: Added support for incremental graph execution.\n* Fix a bug in the WALS solver when single-threaded.\n* Added support for integer sparse feature values in `tf.contrib.layers.sparse_column_with_keys`.\n* Fixed `tf.set_random_seed(0)` to be deterministic for all ops.\n* Stability improvements for the GCS file system support.\n* Improved TensorForest performance.\n* Added support for multiple filename globs in `tf.matching_files`.\n* `LogMessage` now includes a timestamp as beginning of a message.\n* Added MultiBox person detector example standalone binary.\n* Android demo: Makefile build functionality added to build.gradle to fully support building TensorFlow demo in Android on Windows.\n* Android demo: read MultiBox priors from txt file rather than protobuf.\n* Added colocation constraints to `StagingArea`.\n* `sparse_matmul_op` reenabled for Android builds.\n* Restrict weights rank to be the same as the broadcast target, to avoid ambiguity on broadcast rules.\n* Upgraded libxsmm to 1.7.1 and applied other changes for performance and memory usage.\n* Fixed bfloat16 integration of LIBXSMM sparse mat-mul.\n* Improved performance and reduce memory usage by allowing ops to forward input buffers to output buffers and perform computations in-place.\n* Improved the performance of CPU assignment for strings.\n* Speed up matrix * vector multiplication and matrix * matrix with unknown shapes.\n* C API: Graph imports now support input remapping, control dependencies, and returning imported nodes (see `TF_GraphImportGraphDefWithReturnOutputs()`)\n* Multiple C++ API updates.\n* Multiple TensorBoard updates including:\n  * Users can now view image summaries at various sampled steps (instead of just the last step).\n  * Bugs involving switching runs as well as the image dashboard are fixed.\n  * Removed data download links from TensorBoard.\n  * TensorBoard uses a relative data directory, for easier embedding.\n  * TensorBoard automatically ignores outliers for domain calculation, and formats proportional values consistently.\n* Multiple tfdbg bug fixes:\n  * Fixed Windows compatibility issues.\n  * Command history now persists across runs.\n  * Bug fix in graph validation related to `tf.while_loops`.\n* Java Maven fixes for bugs with Windows installation.\n* Backport fixes and improvements from external keras.\n* Keras config file handling fix.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nA.

These were never intended to be exposed. Please use the same objects through top-level `tf` module instead.\n\n# Release 1.0.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n* XLA (experimental): initial release of [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/experimental/xla/), a domain-specific compiler for TensorFlow graphs, that targets CPUs and GPUs.\n* TensorFlow Debugger (tfdbg): command-line interface and API.\n* New python 3 docker images added.\n* Made pip packages pypi compliant. TensorFlow can now be installed by `pip\n  install tensorflow` command.\n* Several python API calls have been changed to resemble NumPy more closely.\n* Android: person detection + tracking demo implementing Scalable Object\n  Detection using Deep Neural Networks.\n* New (experimental) [Java API](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/java).\n* Add new Android image stylization demo based on \"A Learned Representation For Artistic Style\", and add YOLO object detector support.\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\nTo help you upgrade your existing TensorFlow Python code to match the API changes below, we have prepared a [conversion script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/tools/compatibility).\n* TensorFlow/models have been moved to a separate github repository.\n* Division and modulus operators (/, //, %) now match Python (flooring)\n  semantics. This applies to `tf.div` and `tf.mod` as well. To obtain forced\n  integer truncation based behaviors you can use `tf.truncatediv`\n  and `tf.truncatemod`.\n* `tf.divide()` is now the recommended division function. `tf.div()` will\n  remain, but its semantics do not respond to Python 3 or `from future`\n  mechanisms.\n* tf.reverse() now takes indices of axes to be reversed. E.g.\n  `tf.reverse(a, [True, False, True])` must now be written as\n  `tf.reverse(a, [0, 2])`. `tf.reverse_v2()` will remain until 1.0 final.\n* `tf.mul`, `tf.sub` and `tf.neg` are deprecated in favor of `tf.multiply`,\n  `tf.subtract` and `tf.negative`.\n* `tf.pack` and `tf.unpack` are deprecated in favor of `tf.stack` and\n  `tf.unstack`.\n* `TensorArray.pack` and `TensorArray.unpack` are getting deprecated in favor of\n  `TensorArray.stack` and `TensorArray.unstack`.\n* The following Python functions have had their arguments changed to use `axis`\n  when referring to specific dimensions. We have kept the old keyword arguments\n  for compatibility currently, but we will be removing them well before the\n  final 1.0.\n  * `tf.argmax`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.argmin`: `dimension` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.count_nonzero`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.expand_dims`: `dim` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_all`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_any`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_join`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_logsumexp`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_max`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_mean`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_min`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_prod`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reduce_sum`: `reduction_indices` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.reverse_sequence`: `batch_dim` becomes `batch_axis`, `seq_dim` becomes `seq_axis`\n  * `tf.sparse_concat`: `concat_dim` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.sparse_reduce_sum`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.sparse_reduce_sum_sparse`: `reduction_axes` becomes `axis`\n  * `tf.sparse_split`: `split_dim` becomes `axis`\n* `tf.listdiff` has been renamed to `tf.setdiff1d` to match NumPy naming.\n* `tf.inv` has been renamed to be `tf.reciprocal` (component-wise reciprocal)\n  to avoid confusion with `np.inv` which is matrix inversion\n* tf.round now uses banker's rounding (round to even) semantics to match NumPy.\n* `tf.split` now takes arguments in a reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular, we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.split(value, num_or_size_splits, axis)`.\n* `tf.sparse_split` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different\n  keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as\n  `tf.sparse_split(sp_input, num_split, axis)`. NOTE: we have temporarily\n  made `tf.sparse_split` require keyword arguments.\n* `tf.concat` now takes arguments in reversed order and with different keywords. In particular we now match NumPy order as `tf.concat(values, axis, name)`.\n* `tf.image.decode_jpeg` by default uses the faster DCT method, sacrificing\n  a little fidelity for improved speed. One can revert to the old\n  behavior by specifying the attribute `dct_method='INTEGER_ACCURATE'`.\n* `tf.complex_abs` has been removed from the Python interface. `tf.abs`\n  supports complex tensors and should be used instead.\n* In the C++ API (in tensorflow/cc), Input, Output, etc. have moved\n  from the tensorflow::ops namespace to tensorflow.\n* Template.`var_scope` property renamed to `.variable_scope`\n* SyncReplicasOptimizer is removed and SyncReplicasOptimizerV2 renamed to SyncReplicasOptimizer.\n* `tf.zeros_initializer()` and `tf.ones_initializer()` now return a callable\n  that must be called with initializer arguments, in your code replace\n  `tf.zeros_initializer` with `tf.zeros_initializer()`.\n* `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for\n  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.\n* Replace tf.scalar_summary, tf.histogram_summary, tf.audio_summary, tf.image_summary with tf.summary.scalar, tf.summary.histogram, tf.summary.audio, tf.summary.image, respectively. The new summary ops take name rather than tag as their first argument, meaning summary ops now respect TensorFlow name scopes.\n* Replace tf.train.SummaryWriter and tf.train.SummaryWriterCache with tf.summary.FileWriter and tf.summary.FileWriterCache.\n* Removes RegisterShape from public API. Use C++ shape function registration\n  instead.\n* Deprecated `_ref` dtypes from the python API.\n* In the C++ API (in tensorflow/cc), Input, Output, etc. have moved\n  from the tensorflow::ops namespace to tensorflow.\n* Change arg order for `{softmax,sparse_softmax,sigmoid}_cross_entropy_with_logits` to be (labels, predictions), and force use of named args.\n* tf.nn.rnn_cell.* and most functions in tf.nn.rnn.* (with the exception of dynamic_rnn and raw_rnn) are temporarily in tf.contrib.rnn.  They will be moved back into core for TF 1.2.\n* `tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss` and `tf.nn.nce_loss` have both changed their API such that you need to switch the `inputs, labels` to `labels, inputs` parameters.\n* The shape keyword argument of the `SparseTensor` constructor changes its name to `dense_shape` between Tensorflow 0.12 and Tensorflow 1.0.\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n* Numerous C++ API updates.\n* New op: `parallel_stack`.\n* Introducing common tf io compression options constants for\n  RecordReader/RecordWriter.\n* Add `sparse_column_with_vocabulary_file`, to specify a feature column that\n  transform string features to IDs, where the mapping is defined by a vocabulary\n  file.\n* Added `index_to_string_table` which returns a lookup table that maps indices to\n  strings.\n* Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n* Add a `ParallelForWithWorkerId` function.\n* Add `string_to_index_table`, which returns a lookup table that matches strings\n  to indices.\n* Support restore session from checkpoint files in v2 in `contrib/session_bundle`.\n* Added a tf.contrib.image.rotate function for arbitrary angles.\n* Added `tf.contrib.framework.filter_variables` as a convenience function to\n  filter lists of variables based on regular expressions.\n* `make_template()` takes an optional `custom_getter_ param`.\n* Added comment about how existing directories are handled by\n  `recursive_create_dir`.\n* Added an op for QR factorizations.\n* Divides and mods in Python API now use flooring (Python) semantics.\n* Android: pre-built libs are now built nightly.\n* Android: cmake/gradle build for TensorFlow Inference library under\n  `contrib/android/cmake`\n* Android: Much more robust Session initialization code.\n* Android: TF stats now exposed directly in demo and log when debug mode is\n  active\n* Android: new/better README.md documentation\n* saved_model is available as `tf.saved_model`.\n* Empty op is now stateful.\n* Improve speed of scatter_update on the cpu for ASSIGN operations.\n* Change `reduce_join` to treat `reduction_indices` in the same way as other `reduce_` ops.\n* Move `TensorForestEstimator` to `contrib/tensor_forest`.\n* Enable compiler optimizations by default and allow configuration in configure.\n* `tf.divide` now honors the name field.\n* Make metrics weight broadcasting more strict.\n* Add new queue-like `StagingArea` and new ops: `stage` and `unstage`.\n* Enable inplace update ops for strings on CPU. Speed up string concat.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAaron Hu, Abhishek Aggarwal, Adam Michael, Adriano Carmezim, @AfirSraftGarrier,\nAlexander Novikov, Alexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andrew Gibiansky, Andrew Hundt,\nAnish Shah, Anton Loss, @b0noI, @BoyuanJiang, Carl Thom\u00e9, Chad Kennedy, Comic\nChang, Connor Braa, Daniel N.

Supported languages include Python (via a\n  pip package) and C++. CUDA 8.0 and cuDNN 5.1 are supported for GPU\n  acceleration. Known limitations include: It is not currently possible to load\n  a custom op library. The GCS and HDFS file systems are not currently\n  supported. The following ops are not currently implemented:\n  Dequantize, QuantizeAndDequantize, QuantizedAvgPool,\n  QuantizedBatchNomWithGlobalNormalization, QuantizedBiasAdd, QuantizedConcat,\n  QuantizedConv2D, QuantizedMatmul, QuantizedMaxPool,\n  QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange, QuantizedRelu, QuantizedRelu6, QuantizedReshape,\n  QuantizeV2, RequantizationRange, and Requantize.\n* Go: Experimental API in Go to create and execute graphs\n  (https://godoc.org/github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go)\n* New checkpoint format becomes the default in `tf.train.Saver`. Old V1\n  checkpoints continue to be readable; controlled by the `write_version`\n  argument, `tf.train.Saver` now by default writes out in the new V2\n  format. It significantly reduces the peak memory required and latency\n  incurred during restore.\n* Added a new library for library of matrix-free (iterative) solvers for linear\n  equations, linear least-squares, eigenvalues and singular values in\n  tensorflow/contrib/solvers. Initial version has lanczos bidiagonalization,\n  conjugate gradients and CGLS.\n* Added gradients for `matrix_solve_ls` and `self_adjoint_eig`.\n* Large cleanup to add second order gradient for ops with C++ gradients and\n  improve existing gradients such that most ops can now be differentiated\n  multiple times.\n* Added a solver for ordinary differential equations,\n  `tf.contrib.integrate.odeint`.\n* New contrib module for tensors with named axes, `tf.contrib.labeled_tensor`.\n* Visualization of embeddings in TensorBoard.\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n\n* `BusAdjacency` enum replaced with a protocol buffer `DeviceLocality`.  PCI bus\n  indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and `bus_id==0` is used where\n  previously `BUS_ANY` was used.\n* `Env::FileExists` and `FileSystem::FileExists` now return a tensorflow::Status\n  instead of a bool. Any callers to this function can be converted to a bool\n  by adding .ok() to the call.\n* The C API type `TF_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF_Session`,\n  indicating its preferred use in language bindings for TensorFlow.\n  What was previously `TF_Session` has been renamed to `TF_DeprecatedSession`.\n* Renamed `TF_Port` to `TF_Output` in the C API.\n* Removes RegisterShape from public API. Use C++ shape function registration instead.\n  indexing now starts from 1 instead of 0, and `bus_id==0` is used where\n  previously `BUS_ANY` was used.\n* Most RNN cells and RNN functions now use different variable scopes to be\n  consistent with layers (`tf.contrib.layers`).  This means old checkpoints\n  written using this code will not load after this change without providing\n  `Saver` a list of variable renames.  Examples of variable scope changes\n  include `RNN` -> `rnn` in `tf.nn.rnn`, `tf.nn.dynamic_rnn` and moving from\n  `Linear/Matrix` -> `weights` and `Linear/Bias` -> `biases` in most RNN cells.\n* Deprecated tf.select op. tf.where should be used instead.\n* `SparseTensor.shape` has been renamed to `SparseTensor.dense_shape`.  Same for\n  `SparseTensorValue.shape`.\n* `Env::FileExists` and `FileSystem::FileExists` now return a\n  `tensorflow::Status` instead of a bool. Any callers to this function can be\n  converted to a bool by adding `.ok()` to the call.\n* C API: Type `TF_SessionWithGraph` has been renamed to `TF_Session`, indicating\n  its preferred use in language bindings for TensorFlow. What was previously\n  `TF_Session` has been renamed to `TF_DeprecatedSession`.\n* C API: Renamed `TF_Port` to `TF_Output`.\n* C API: The caller retains ownership of `TF_Tensor` objects provided to\n  `TF_Run`, `TF_SessionRun`, `TF_SetAttrTensor` etc.\n* Renamed `tf.image.per_image_whitening()` to\n  `tf.image.per_image_standardization()`\n* Move Summary protobuf constructors to `tf.summary` submodule.\n* Deprecate `histogram_summary`, `audio_summary`, `scalar_summary`,\n  `image_summary`, `merge_summary`, and `merge_all_summaries`.\n* Combined `batch_*` and regular version of linear algebra and FFT ops. The\n  regular op now handles batches as well. All `batch_*` Python interfaces were\n  removed.\n* `tf.all_variables`, `tf.VARIABLES` and `tf.initialize_all_variables` renamed\n  to `tf.global_variables`, `tf.GLOBAL_VARIABLES` and\n  `tf.global_variables_initializer` respectively.\n* `tf.zeros_initializer()` and `tf.ones_initializer()` now return a callable\n  that must be called with initializer arguments, in your code replace\n  `tf.zeros_initializer` with `tf.zeros_initializer()`\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n* Use threadsafe version of `lgamma` function.\n* Fix `tf.sqrt` handling of negative arguments.\n* Fixed bug causing incorrect number of threads to be used for multi-threaded\n  benchmarks.\n* Performance optimizations for `batch_matmul` on multi-core CPUs.\n* Improve trace, `matrix_set_diag`, `matrix_diag_part` and their gradients to\n  work for rectangular matrices.\n* Support for SVD of complex valued matrices.\n\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\n@a7744hsc, Abhi Agg, @admcrae, Adriano Carmezim, Aki Sukegawa, Alex Kendall,\nAlexander Rosenberg Johansen, @amcrae, Amlan Kar, Andre Simpelo, Andreas Eberle,\nAndrew Hundt, Arnaud Lenglet, @b0noI, Balachander Ramachandran, Ben Barsdell,\nBen Guidarelli, Benjamin Mularczyk, Burness Duan, @c0g, Changming Sun,\n@chanis, Corey Wharton, Dan J, Daniel Trebbien, Darren Garvey, David Brailovsky,\nDavid Jones, Di Zeng, @DjangoPeng, Dr. Kashif Rasul, @drag0, Fabrizio (Misto)\nMilo, Fabr\u00edCio Ceschin, @fp, @Ghedeon, @guschmue, G\u00f6k\u00e7en Eraslan, Haosdent\nHuang, Haroen Viaene, Harold Cooper, Henrik Holst, @hoangmit, Ivan Ukhov, Javier\nDehesa, Jingtian Peng, Jithin Odattu, Joan Pastor, Johan Mathe, Johannes Mayer,\nJongwook Choi, Justus Schwabedal, Kai Wolf, Kamil Hryniewicz, Kamran Amini,\nKaren Brems, Karl Lattimer, @kborer, Ken Shirriff, Kevin Rose, Larissa Laich,\nLaurent Mazare, Leonard Lee, Liang-Chi Hsieh, Liangliang He, Luke Iwanski,\nMarek Kolodziej, Moustafa Alzantot, @MrQianjinsi, @nagachika, Neil Han, Nick\nMeehan, Niels Ole Salscheider, Nikhil Mishra, @nschuc, Ondrej Skopek, Ond\u0159Ej\nFilip, @OscarDPan, Pablo Moyano, Przemyslaw Tredak, @qitaishui, @Quarazy,\n@raix852, Philipp Helo, Sam Abrahams, @SriramRamesh, Till Hoffmann, Tushar Soni,\n@tvn, @tyfkda, Uwe Schmidt, Victor Villas, Vit Stepanovs, Vladislav Gubarev,\n@wujingyue, Xuesong Yang, Yi Liu, Yilei Yang, @youyou3, Yuan (Terry) Tang,\nYuming Wang, Zafar Takhirov, @zhongyuk, Ziming Dong, @guotong1988\n\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.\n\n# Release 0.11.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* CUDA 8 support.\n* cuDNN 5 support.\n* HDFS Support.\n* Adds Fused LSTM support via cuDNN 5 in `tensorflow/contrib/cudnn_rnn`.\n* Improved support for NumPy style basic slicing including non-1 strides,\n  ellipses, newaxis, and negative indices. For example complicated expressions\n  like `foo[1, 2:4, tf.newaxis, ..., :-3:-1, :]` are now supported. In addition\n  we have preliminary (non-broadcasting) support for sliced assignment to\n  variables. In particular one can write `var[1:3].assign([1,11,111])`.\n* Deprecated `tf.op_scope` and `tf.variable_op_scope` in favor of a unified `tf.name_scope` and `tf.variable_scope`. The new argument order of `tf.variable_scope` is incompatible with previous versions.\n* Introducing `core/util/tensor_bundle` module: a module to efficiently\n  serialize/deserialize tensors to disk.  Will be used in TF's new checkpoint\n  format.\n* Added tf.svd for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of dense\n  matrices or batches of matrices (CPU only).\n* Added gradients for eigenvalues and eigenvectors computed using\n  `self_adjoint_eig` or `self_adjoint_eigvals`.\n* Eliminated `batch_*` methods for most linear algebra and FFT ops and promoted\n  the non-batch version of the ops to handle batches of matrices.\n* Tracing/timeline support for distributed runtime (no GPU profiler yet).\n* C API gives access to inferred shapes with `TF_GraphGetTensorNumDims` and\n  `TF_GraphGetTensorShape`.\n* Shape functions for core ops have moved to C++ via\n  `REGISTER_OP(...).SetShapeFn(...)`.  Python shape inference RegisterShape calls\n  use the C++ shape functions with `common_shapes.call_cpp_shape_fn`.  A future\n  release will remove `RegisterShape` from python.\n\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n* Documentation now includes operator overloads on Tensor and Variable.\n* `tensorflow.__git_version__` now allows users to identify the version of the\n  code that TensorFlow was compiled with. We also have\n  `tensorflow.__git_compiler__` which identifies the compiler used to compile\n  TensorFlow's core.\n* Improved multi-threaded performance of `batch_matmul`.\n* LSTMCell, BasicLSTMCell, and MultiRNNCell constructors now default to\n  `state_is_tuple=True`.  For a quick fix while transitioning to the new\n  default, simply pass the argument `state_is_tuple=False`.\n* DeviceFactory's AddDevices and CreateDevices functions now return\n  a Status instead of void.\n* Int32 elements of list(type) arguments are no longer placed in host memory by\n  default. If necessary, a list(type) argument to a kernel can be placed in host\n  memory using a HostMemory annotation.\n* `uniform_unit_scaling_initializer()` no longer takes a `full_shape` arg,\n  instead relying on the partition info passed to the initializer function when\n  it's called.\n* The NodeDef protocol message is now defined in its own file `node_def.proto`\n  `instead of graph.proto`.\n* `ops.NoGradient` was renamed `ops.NotDifferentiable`. `ops.NoGradient` will\n  be removed soon.\n* `dot.h` / DotGraph was removed (it was an early analysis tool prior\n  to TensorBoard, no longer that useful).  It remains in history\n  should someone find the code useful.\n* re2 / regexp.h was removed from being a public interface of TF.\n  Should users need regular expressions, they should depend on the RE2\n  library directly rather than via TensorFlow.\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAbid K, @afshinrahimi, @AidanGG, Ajay Rao, Aki Sukegawa, Alex Rothberg,\nAlexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andrew Gibiansky, Andrew Thomas, @Appleholic,\nBastiaan Quast, Ben Dilday, Bofu Chen, Brandon Amos, Bryon Gloden, Cissp\u00ae,\n@chanis, Chenyang Liu, Corey Wharton, Daeyun Shin, Daniel Julius Lasiman, Daniel\nWaterworth, Danijar Hafner, Darren Garvey, Denis Gorbachev, @DjangoPeng,\nEgor-Krivov, Elia Palme, Eric Platon, Fabrizio Milo, Gaetan Semet,\nGeorg Nebehay, Gu Wang, Gustav Larsson, @haosdent, Harold Cooper, Hw-Zz,\n@ichuang, Igor Babuschkin, Igor Macedo Quintanilha, Ilya Edrenkin, @ironhead,\nJakub Kolodziejczyk, Jennifer Guo, Jihun Choi, Jonas Rauber, Josh Bleecher\nSnyder, @jpangburn, Jules Gagnon-Marchand, Karen Brems, @kborer, Kirill Bobyrev,\nLaurent Mazare, Longqi Yang, Malith Yapa, Maniteja Nandana, Martin Englund,\nMatthias Winkelmann, @mecab, Mu-Ik Jeon, Nand Dalal, Niels Ole Salscheider,\nNikhil Mishra, Park Jiin, Pieter De Rijk, @raix852, Ritwik Gupta, Sahil Sharma,\nSangheum Hwang, @SergejsRk, Shinichiro Hamaji, Simon Denel, @Steve, @suiyuan2009,\nTiago Jorge, Tijmen Tieleman, @tvn, @tyfkda, Wang Yang, Wei-Ting Kuo, Wenjian\nHuang, Yan Chen, @YenChenLin, Yuan (Terry) Tang, Yuncheng Li, Yunfeng Wang, Zack\nPolizzi, @zhongzyd, Ziming Dong, @perhapszzy\n\nWe are also grateful to all who filed issues or helped resolve them, asked and\nanswered questions, and were part of inspiring discussions.\n\n# Release 0.10.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* Added support for C++ shape inference\n* Added graph-construction C API\n* Major revision to the graph-construction C++ API\n* Support makefile build for iOS\n* Added Mac GPU support\n* Full version of TF-Slim available as `tf.contrib.slim`\n* Added k-Means clustering and WALS matrix factorization\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n* Allow gradient computation for scalar values.\n* Performance improvements for gRPC\n* Improved support for fp16\n* New high-level ops in tf.contrib.{layers,metrics}\n* New features for TensorBoard, such as shape display, exponential smoothing\n* Faster and more stable Google Cloud Storage (GCS) filesystem support\n* Support for zlib compression and decompression for TFRecordReader and TFRecordWriter\n* Support for reading (animated) GIFs\n* Improved support for SparseTensor\n* Added support for more probability distributions (Dirichlet, Beta, Bernoulli, etc.)\n* Added Python interfaces to reset resource containers.\n* Many bugfixes and performance improvements\n* Many documentation fixes\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAlex Rothberg, Andrew Royer, Austin Marshall, @BlackCoal, Bob Adolf, Brian Diesel, Charles-Emmanuel Dias, @chemelnucfin, Chris Lesniewski, Daeyun Shin, Daniel Rodriguez, Danijar Hafner, Darcy Liu, Kristinn R.

Lower versions of cuda/cudnn can\n  be supported by installing from sources and setting the options\n  during ./configure\n* Fix dataset encoding example for Python3 (@danijar)\n* Fix PIP installation by not packaging protobuf as part of wheel,\n  require protobuf 3.0.0b2.\n* Fix Mac pip installation of numpy by requiring pip >= 1.10.1.\n* Improvements and fixes to Docker image.\n\n\n# Release 0.7.0\n\n## Major Features and Improvements\n\n* Allow using any installed Cuda >= 7.0 and cuDNN >= R2, and add support\n  for cuDNN R4\n* Added a `contrib/` directory for unsupported or experimental features,\n  including higher level `layers` module\n* Added an easy way to add and dynamically load user-defined ops\n* Built out a good suite of tests, things should break less!\n* Added `MetaGraphDef` which makes it easier to save graphs with metadata\n* Added assignments for \"Deep Learning with TensorFlow\" udacity course\n\n\n## Bug Fixes and Other Changes\n\n* Added a versioning framework for `GraphDef`s to ensure compatibility\n* Enforced Python 3 compatibility\n* Internal changes now show up as sensibly separated commits\n* Open-sourced the doc generator\n* Un-fork Eigen\n* Simplified the `BUILD` files and cleaned up C++ headers\n* TensorFlow can now be used as a submodule in another bazel build\n* New ops (e.g., `*fft`, `*_matrix_solve`)\n* Support for more data types in many ops\n* Performance improvements\n* Various bugfixes\n* Documentation fixes and improvements\n\n\n## Breaking Changes to the API\n\n* `AdjustContrast` kernel deprecated, new kernel `AdjustContrastv2` takes and\n  outputs float only. `adjust_contrast` now takes all data types.\n* `adjust_brightness`'s `delta` argument is now always assumed to be in `[0,1]`\n  (as is the norm for images in floating point formats), independent of the\n  data type of the input image.\n* The image processing ops do not take `min` and `max` inputs any more, casting\n  safety is handled by `saturate_cast`, which makes sure over- and underflows\n  are handled before casting to data types with smaller ranges.\n* For C++ API users: `IsLegacyScalar` and `IsLegacyVector` are now gone from\n  `TensorShapeUtils` since TensorFlow is scalar strict within Google (for\n  example, the shape argument to `tf.reshape` can't be a scalar anymore).  The\n  open source release was already scalar strict, so outside Google `IsScalar`\n  and `IsVector` are exact replacements.\n* The following files are being removed from `tensorflow/core/public/`:\n    * `env.h` -> `../platform/env.h`\n    * `status.h` -> `../lib/core/status.h`\n    * `tensor.h` -> `../framework/tensor.h`\n    * `tensor_shape.h` -> `../framework/tensor_shape.h`\n    * `partial_tensor_shape.h` -> `../framework/partial_tensor_shape.h`\n    * `tensorflow_server.h` deleted\n* For C++ API users: `TensorShape::ShortDebugString` has been renamed to\n  `DebugString`, and the previous `DebugString` behavior is gone (it was\n  needlessly verbose and produced a confusing empty string for scalars).\n* `GraphOptions.skip_common_subexpression_elimination` has been removed. All\n  graph optimizer options are now specified via\n  `GraphOptions.OptimizerOptions`.\n* `ASSERT_OK` / `EXPECT_OK` macros conflicted with external projects, so they\n  were renamed `TF_ASSERT_OK`, `TF_EXPECT_OK`.  The existing macros are\n  currently maintained for short-term compatibility but will be removed.\n* The non-public `nn.rnn` and the various `nn.seq2seq` methods now return\n  just the final state instead of the list of all states.\n* `tf.scatter_update` now no longer guarantees that lexicographically largest\n  index be used for update when duplicate entries exist.\n* `tf.image.random_crop(image, [height, width])` is now\n  `tf.random_crop(image, [height, width, depth])`, and `tf.random_crop` works\n  for any rank (not just 3-D images).  The C++ `RandomCrop` op has been replaced\n  with pure Python.\n* Renamed `tf.test.GetTempDir` and `tf.test.IsBuiltWithCuda` to\n  `tf.test.get_temp_dir` and `tf.test.is_built_with_cuda` for PEP-8\n  compatibility.\n* `parse_example`'s interface has changed, the old interface is accessible in\n  `legacy_parse_example` (same for related functions).\n* New `Variable`s are not added to the same collection several times even if\n  a list with duplicates is passed to the constructor.\n* The Python API will now properly set the `list` member of `AttrValue` in\n  constructed `GraphDef` messages for empty lists.  The serialization of some\n  graphs will change, but the change is both forwards and backwards compatible.\n  It will break tests that compare a generated `GraphDef` to a golden serialized\n  `GraphDef` (which is discouraged).\n\n\n## Thanks to our Contributors\n\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n\nAkiomi Kamakura, Alex Vig, Alexander Rosenberg Johansen, Andre Cruz, Arun Ahuja,\nBart Coppens, Bernardo Pires, Carl Vondrick, Cesar Salgado, Chen Yu,\nChristian Jauvin, Damien Aymeric, Dan Vanderkam, Denny Britz, Dongjoon Hyun,\nEren G\u00fcven, Erik Erwitt, Fabrizio Milo, G.

Improvements mostly due\n  to moving to 32-bit indices, faster shuffling kernels.  More improvements to\n  come in later releases.\n\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n* Lots of fixes to documentation and tutorials, many contributed\n  by the public.\n\n* 271 closed issues on github issues.\n\n## Backwards-Incompatible Changes\n\n* `tf.nn.fixed_unigram_candidate_sampler` changed its default 'distortion'\n  attribute from 0.0 to 1.0. This was a bug in the original release\n  that is now fixed.\n\n# Release 0.5.0\n\nInitial release of TensorFlow.\n", "# Copyright 2017 The TensorFlow Authors.
