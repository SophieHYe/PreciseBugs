TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. When printing a tensor, we get it's data as a `const char*` array (since that's the underlying storage) and then we typecast it to the element type. However, conversions from `char` to `bool` are undefined if the `char` is not `0` or `1`, so sanitizers/fuzzers will crash. The issue has been patched in GitHub commit `1be74370327`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, TensorFlow 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
