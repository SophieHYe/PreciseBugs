Enhancement:
- Added "info:ofi/pro" to the list of namespaces that can be parsed by XMLFileOAICatalog.
- Added XSLTproCrosswalk
- Changed the Redirect extension verb to return the oai_dc record if no dc:identifier is found.

2003-06-13 1.5.13
Bug Fix:
- Allow for missing User-Agent in HTTP header.

2003-06-05 1.5.12
Bug Fix:
- XML Encode the <identifier> portion of the response.

2003-06-03 1.5.11
Bug Fix:
- Fixed a few more bugs in JDBCOAICatalog where OAI-type Exceptions were
  being caught and transformed into Error 500 failures.

2003-05-14 1.5.10
Bug Fix:
- Fixed a bug in JDBCOAICatalog where invalid identifiers weren't being reported properly from GetRecord verbs.

2003-05-05 1.5.10
Enhancement:
- Add call to ServerVerb.init for extension verbs to allow them to initialize themselves.
- Add call to HttpServletRequest.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8") to handle escaped characters in the URL.

2003-04-29 1.5.9
Bug Fix:
- Moved extension verbs so they only work from baseURL + "/extension". This should satisfy those who worry about adding non-OAI verbs to the baseURL. Also changed the property from ServerVerbs.* to ExtensionVerbs.*
- Fixed ListRecords and ListIdentifiers to convert blanks back to '+'. Hopefully, this won't cause people too much grief.

2003-04-21 1.5.8
Enhancements:
- Added an optional Redirect verb to support POIs (http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/distributed-systems/poi/resolver-guidelines/.
- Added JUnit tests to the Ant build scripts.
- Added a little more documentation
- Improved version control.
- Fixed a bug where setting the HTTP Content-Encoding prevented the return of HTTP status codes.

2003-04-17 1.5.7
Bg fixes:
- Removed URLEncoder.encode() calls in RecordFactory and ServerVerb because URLEncoding setSpecs isn't the right solution. I don't recall why I did this in the first place, and now I worry that it will break someone's existing installation because they are gone. If so, hopefully they will contact me and we can fix it propertly.
Enhancements
- Add an OAIHarvester.forceRender property to discourage the harvesting of proprietary data.
- Add a RecordFactory.encodeSetSpec parameter (default=true) since it's not really supposed to encode colons. Eventually, this will need to be fixed properly to encode only those characters that actually require it.

2003-03-28 1.5.6
Enhancements
- Allow for additional verbs to be configured in oaicat.properties.
- Added an optional GetMetadata verb.

2003-03-06 1.5.5
Enhancements
- Added an optional OAIHandler.renderForOldBrowsers property to recognize old "Mozilla" browsers and render the response into HTML if an OAIHandler.styleSheet property is present.

2002-11-18 1.5.4
Bug fixes:
- Removed 'compress' compression option since there is some question about its correctness.
- URLEncoded the request element's set value.
- Fixed a bug in the JDBC implementation that caused resumptionTokens to always respond with initial results.
Enhancements
- Added a FileSystem implementation and made it the default instead of the silly useless DummyOAICatalog.
- Moved the toolkit element to the bottom of the Identify response to make it less prominent.

2002-11-01 1.5.3
Bug fixes:
- Made JDBC2oai_dc real.
- Change setSpec handling to allow them to be collected from the database itself.
- Use a HashMap to represent a record rather than depending on the cursor of an entire resultSet.
- Changes too numerous to mention regarding JDBCOAICatalog. If you're using it, consider using JDBCLimitedOAICatalog instead. It should be more memory effecient.
- Added a new class named NoRecordMatchException which is a more appropriate name than NoItemsMatchException. Both work, though.
- Fixed a bug in the Identify response where the toolkit description wasn't passing validation.
- Changed the default 'from' and 'until' dates to something more realistic.


2002-10-22 1.5.2
Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug in the JDBC implementation that caused resumptionToken type
  requests to return the initial set of records each time.
- Made resumptionTokens in the JDBC implementation idempotent.
- Changed the default 'from' date from 01/01/0000 to 01/01/0001 to
  accommodate Oracle JDBC limitations.
- Fixed a problem with ListMetadataFormats in the JDBC implementation where it didn't recognize oaiidentifiers that weren't in sets.

2002-10-16 1.5.1
Enhancements:
- Added a JDBC implementation

2002-10-04 1.5
Enhancements:
- Added toolkit description to the Identify response and version number tracking.

2002-10-02 1.4
Bug Fixes:
- Added a check for bad arguments when they accompany resumptionTokens
  to satisfy the OAI repository registration validator.

2002-09-27 1.3
Enhancements:
- Added cusomization instructions to the Readme.txt file.
- Improved javadocs.

2002-09-25 1.2
Bug Fixes:

  Explorer validation.

Enhancements:
