An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of IEEE80211_P2P_ATTR_OPER_CHANNEL in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger an out-of-bounds write when parsing the channel list attribute from Wi-Fi management frames.
