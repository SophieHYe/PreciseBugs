An issue was discovered in the ALU unit of the OR1200 (aka OpenRISC 1200) processor 2011-09-10 through 2015-11-11. The overflow flag is not being updated correctly for the subtract instruction, which results in an incorrect value in the overflow flag. Any software that relies on this flag may experience corruption in execution.
