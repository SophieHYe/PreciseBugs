nbgitpuller is a Jupyter server extension to sync a git repository one-way to a local path. Due to unsanitized input, visiting maliciously crafted links could result in arbitrary code execution in the user environment. This has been resolved in version 0.10.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. No work around exist for users who can not upgrade.
