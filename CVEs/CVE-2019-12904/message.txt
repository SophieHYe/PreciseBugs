** DISPUTED ** In Libgcrypt 1.8.4, the C implementation of AES is vulnerable to a flush-and-reload side-channel attack because physical addresses are available to other processes. (The C implementation is used on platforms where an assembly-language implementation is unavailable.) NOTE: the vendor's position is that the issue report cannot be validated because there is no description of an attack.
