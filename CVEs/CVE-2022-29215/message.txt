RegionProtect is a plugin that allows users to manage certain events in certain regions of the world. Versions prior to 1.1.0 contain a YAML injection vulnerability that can cause an instant server crash if the passed arguments are not matched. Version 1.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, restrict operator permissions to untrusted people and avoid entering arguments likely to cause a crash.
