Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Unauthenticated users can leak the contents of files of the local system accessible to the web-server user, including `icingaweb2` configuration files with database credentials. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2. Database credentials should be rotated.
