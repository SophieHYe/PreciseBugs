An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.0.11. Missing validation of IEEE80211_P2P_ATTR_CHANNEL_LIST in drivers/net/wireless/microchip/wilc1000/cfg80211.c in the WILC1000 wireless driver can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing the operating channel attribute from Wi-Fi management frames.
