Kitchen-Terraform provides a set of Test Kitchen plugins which enable the use of Test Kitchen to converge a Terraform configuration and verify the resulting infrastructure systems with InSpec controls. Kitchen-Terraform v7.0.0 introduced a regression which caused all Terraform output values, including sensitive values, to be printed at the `info` logging level during the `kitchen converge` action. Prior to v7.0.0, the output values were printed at the `debug` level to avoid writing sensitive values to the terminal by default. An attacker would need access to the local machine in order to gain access to these logs during an operation. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
