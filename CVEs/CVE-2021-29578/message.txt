TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. The implementation of `tf.raw_ops.FractionalAvgPoolGrad` is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/dcba796a28364d6d7f003f6fe733d82726dda713/tensorflow/core/kernels/fractional_avg_pool_op.cc#L216) fails to validate that the pooling sequence arguments have enough elements as required by the `out_backprop` tensor shape. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
