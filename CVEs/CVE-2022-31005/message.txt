Vapor is an HTTP web framework for Swift. Users of Vapor prior to version 4.60.3 with FileMiddleware enabled are vulnerable to an integer overflow vulnerability that can crash the application. Version 4.60.3 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable FileMiddleware and serve via a Content Delivery Network.
