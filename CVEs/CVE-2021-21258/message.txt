GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In GLPI from version 9.5.0 and before version 9.5.4, there is a cross-site scripting injection vulnerability when using ajax/kanban.php. This is fixed in version 9.5.4.
