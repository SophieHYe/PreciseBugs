The DecodeGifImg function in ngiflib.c in MiniUPnP ngiflib 0.4 does not consider the bounds of the pixels data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (WritePixels heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted GIF file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-10677.
