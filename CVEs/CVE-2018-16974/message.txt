An issue was discovered in Elefant CMS before 2.0.7. There is a PHP Code Execution Vulnerability in apps/filemanager/upload/drop.php by using /filemanager/api/rm/.htaccess to remove the .htaccess file, and then using a filename that ends in .php followed by space characters (for bypassing the blacklist).
