mechanize, a library for automatically interacting with HTTP web servers, contains a regular expression that is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) prior to version 0.4.6. If a web server responds in a malicious way, then mechanize could crash. Version 0.4.6 has a patch for the issue.
