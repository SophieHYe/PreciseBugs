Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. An attacker can craft a TFLite model that would cause an integer overflow in `TfLiteIntArrayCreate`. The `TfLiteIntArrayGetSizeInBytes` returns an `int` instead of a `size_t. An attacker can control model inputs such that `computed_size` overflows the size of `int` datatype. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
