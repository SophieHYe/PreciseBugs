** DISPUTED ** softmmu/physmem.c in QEMU through 7.0.0 can perform an uninitialized read on the translate_fail path, leading to an io_readx or io_writex crash. NOTE: a third party states that the Non-virtualization Use Case in the qemu.org reference applies here, i.e., "Bugs affecting the non-virtualization use case are not considered security bugs at this time."
