Nes is a websocket extension library for hapi. Hapi is a webserver framework. Versions below and including 6.4.0 have a denial of service vulnerability via an invalid Cookie header. This is only present when websocket authentication is set to `cookie`. Submitting an invalid cookie on the websocket upgrade request will cause the node process to error out.
