CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. This vulnerability may allow attackers to spoof their IP address when the server is behind a reverse proxy. This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.2.11 or later, and configure `Config\App::$proxyIPs`. As a workaround, do not use `$request->getIPAddress()`.
