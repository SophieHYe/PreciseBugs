Discourse is the an open source discussion platform. In affected versions a maliciously crafted request for static assets could cause error responses to be cached by Discourse's default NGINX proxy configuration. A corrected NGINX configuration is included in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
