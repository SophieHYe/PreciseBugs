Express OpenID Connect is an Express JS middleware implementing sign on for Express web apps using OpenID Connect. Users of the `requiresAuth` middleware, either directly or through the default `authRequired` option, are vulnerable to an Open Redirect when the middleware is applied to a catch all route. If all routes under `example.com` are protected with the `requiresAuth` middleware, a visit to `http://example.com//google.com` will be redirected to `google.com` after login because the original url reported by the Express framework is not properly sanitized. This vulnerability affects versions prior to 2.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.
