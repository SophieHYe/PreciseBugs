The TraceStrokePolygon function in MagickCore/draw.c in ImageMagick before 6.9.4-0 and 7.x before 7.0.1-2 mishandles the relationship between the BezierQuantum value and certain strokes data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file.
