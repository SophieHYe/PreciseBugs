Nextcloud Server before 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from Stored XSS in CardDAV image export. The CardDAV image export functionality as implemented in Nextcloud/ownCloud allows the download of images stored within a vCard. Due to not performing any kind of verification on the image content this is prone to a stored Cross-Site Scripting attack.
