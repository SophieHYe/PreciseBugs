detect-character-encoding is an open source character encoding inspection library. In detect-character-encoding v0.6.0 and earlier, data matching no charset causes the Node.js process to crash. The problem has been patched in [detect-character-encoding v0.7.0](https://github.com/sonicdoe/detect-character-encoding/releases/tag/v0.7.0). No workaround are available and all users should update to resolve this issue.
