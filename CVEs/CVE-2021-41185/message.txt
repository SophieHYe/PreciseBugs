Mycodo is an environmental monitoring and regulation system. An exploit in versions prior to 8.12.7 allows anyone with access to endpoints to download files outside the intended directory. A patch has been applied and a release made. Users should upgrade to version 8.12.7. As a workaround, users may manually apply the changes from the fix commit.
