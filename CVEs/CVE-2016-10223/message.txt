An issue was discovered in BigTree CMS before 4.2.15. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the "id" HTTP GET parameter passed to the "core/admin/adjax/dashboard/check-module-integrity.php" URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
