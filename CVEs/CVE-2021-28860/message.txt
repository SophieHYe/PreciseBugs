In Node.js mixme, prior to v0.5.1, an attacker can add or alter properties of an object via '__proto__' through the mutate() and merge() functions. The polluted attribute will be directly assigned to every object in the program. This will put the availability of the program at risk causing a potential denial of service (DoS).
