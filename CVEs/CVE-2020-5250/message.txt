In PrestaShop before version 1.7.6.4, when a customer edits their address, they can freely change the id_address in the form, and thus steal someone else's address. It is the same with CustomerForm, you are able to change the id_customer and change all information of all accounts. The problem is patched in version 1.7.6.4.
