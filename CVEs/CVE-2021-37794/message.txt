A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in FileBrowser < v2.16.0 that allows an authenticated user authorized to upload a malicious .svg file which acts as a stored XSS payload. If this stored XSS payload is triggered by an administrator it will trigger malicious OS commands on the server running the FileBrowser instance.
