October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.421 and before version 1.0.469, an attacker can read local files on an October CMS server via a specially crafted request. Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and v1.1.0.
