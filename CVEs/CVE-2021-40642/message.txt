Textpattern CMS v4.8.7 and older vulnerability exists through Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute via textpattern/lib/txplib_misc.php. The secure flag is not set for txp_login session cookie in the application. If the secure flag is not set, then the cookie will be transmitted in clear-text if the user visits any HTTP URLs within the cookie's scope. An attacker may be able to induce this event by feeding a user suitable links, either directly or via another web site.
