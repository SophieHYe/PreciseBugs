TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. An attacker can read data outside of bounds of heap allocated buffer in `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV3`. This is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/11ff7f80667e6490d7b5174aa6bf5e01886e770f/tensorflow/core/kernels/quantize_and_dequantize_op.cc#L237) does not validate the value of user supplied `axis` attribute before using it to index in the array backing the `input` argument. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3, TensorFlow 2.2.3 and TensorFlow 2.1.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
