In OpenNMS Horizon, versions opennms-1-0-stable through opennms-27.1.0-1; OpenNMS Meridian, versions meridian-foundation-2015.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2019.1.18-1; meridian-foundation-2020.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2020.1.6-1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting, since the function `validateFormInput()` performs improper validation checks on the input sent to the `groupName` and `groupComment` parameters. Due to this flaw, an authenticated attacker could inject arbitrary script and trick other admin users into downloading malicious files which can cause severe damage to the organization using opennms.
