The bnep_sock_ioctl function in net/bluetooth/bnep/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 does not ensure that a certain device field ends with a '\0' character, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory, or cause a denial of service (BUG and system crash), via a BNEPCONNADD command.
