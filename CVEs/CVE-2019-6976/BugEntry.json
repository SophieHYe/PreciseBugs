removed mmap_limit, we now always use windows ... reduces VM use hugely,\n  because mmap windows are freed when their regions are freed, while images\n  are only unmapped when they are closed\n- have a min bytes for mmap windows as well, so we don't make too many tiny\n  windows\n- im_disp2Lab() was broken\n- deprecated.h is now defined in terms of current functionality, rather than\n  repeating

cosmetic changes to nohalo\n- im_magick2vips() needs to invert alpha\n- now (more or less) passes -Wextra\n- added \"fail\" option to im_jpeg2vips: fail with an error on any warning\n  (thank you Ole)\n- started gtk-doc changes\n- renamed im_meta_get_type() and im_header_get_type() as\n  im_meta_get_typeof() and im_header_get_typeof() to prevent confusion with\n  GObject type definers (was

for SetImageOption() so we work with GraphicsMagick too\n- \"header\" sets a non-zero exit code if anything failed\n- add and use im_check_uncoded() and friends\n- matlab load handles column-major and plane-separated images (thanks Mikhail)\n- JPEG save allows \"none\" for profile, meaning don't attach a profile\n- saner, simpler, faster typecasting for im_add(), im_subtract(),\n  im_multiply(), im_divide(), im_remainder()\n- im_remainder() has a float result for float types\n- im_measure() allows sel == NULL, meaning all patches\n- added \"deprecated\" package\n- faster, simpler, better im_max(), im_min, im_avg(), im_deviate()\n- im_max() returns true modulus, not square of modulus, for complex images\n- im_avg() works for complex, returning average modulus\n- im_system() fix (thanks Roland)\n- im_system() rewrite\n- im_maxpos()/im_minpos() are partial and work for complex\n- im_max()/im_min() are now convenience functions\n- im_maxpos_avg() handles complex and multi-band images\n- added im_point(), rewrite im_point_bilinear() in terms of this\n- close callbacks now happen *after* images have closed resources (such as\n  open files) ... this lets them delete temps and stuff.

on 64-bit machines with >2gb images and inplace ops\n  (thanks Christoph)\n- im_generate() checks that im_demand_hint() has been called for this image\n- im_jpeg2vips.c, set scale_num on shrink (thanks Guido)\n- heh argh reading history always stopped after the first line (thanks Haida)\n- added im_histindexed\n- new im_iterate() calls start and stop functions from workers so resources\n  they make are owned by the worker thread ... this makes it possible to have\n  start functions which create mutiple regions and therefore allows\n  im_iterate() to scan more than one image at once\n- threadgroup no longer has any default action, you must attach a work\n  function\n- added im_copy_file()\n- added im_insertset()\n- im_insertplace() allows small to be outside big\n- added im__colour_difference(), colour ops now work on any image format\n- added im_col_display_get_table(), so display tables are now shared by name\n- added im__colour_unary()\n- drop \"set\" postfix from

im_stdif(), im_dilate(), im_erode() all use it to\n  expand their input, so their output now has guess borders, not black borders\n- im_fastcor() now does an im_embed( 1 ) on the output ... the zero borders\n  were very annoying before, since you would usually be searching for the\n  minimum point\n- no change to im_spcor(), since you will usually be searching for the maximum\n- better im_render() cache behaviour under heavy loads\n- im_affine() revised\n\t* clip, resample and transform is now pixel-perfect for all\n\t  inputs (I hope)\n\t* uses the new embed to make sure there are

offset parameter\n- im_mapfile()/im_unmapfile() now work on IMAGE and record the length of the\n  file they mapped ... this lets VIPS successfully unmap a file if it changes\n  size while it's open\n\n20/10/03 started 7.9.1\n- threadgroups now have their own kill flag\n- im_plotmask() now does anti-aliasing\n- im_iterate() fix for operations on mmap window images (thanks Clare)\n- im_writeline() stops on kill\n- fix for im_fwfft() segv for wider-than-high real images (thanks Andrey)\n- fix for im_fwfft() to work for non-square real images (thanks Andrey)\n- can now read and write 32-bit IEEE float TIFF (Andrey Kiselev)\n- clean-ups for colour.c (Andrey Kiselev)\n- no longer lets you make an image with width|height|bands == 0 (thanks Joe)\n- im_vips2tiff(),

removed mmap_limit, we now always use windows ... reduces VM use hugely,\n  because mmap windows are freed when their regions are freed, while images\n  are only unmapped when they are closed\n- have a min bytes for mmap windows as well, so we don't make too many tiny\n  windows\n- im_disp2Lab() was broken\n- deprecated.h is now defined in terms of current functionality, rather than\n  repeating stuff\n- im_flood() and friends rewritten, typically 4x faster\n- removed --with-cimg option, added --disable-cxx\n- added im_system_image() (thanks Roland)\n- added postclose callbacks\n- added

small updates to im_convf() from im_conv()\n- im_read_imask() produced an incorrect error message if passed a doublemask\n- rename im_convf(), im_convsepf() as _f()\n- vips.c drops _f suffix when overloading\n- regenerate C++ binding, don't make deprecated package\n\n9/11/09 started 7.20.0\n- removed vips-7.x.spec.in, shouldn't really have this in SVN\n- bumped version to 7.20\n- fixes to get

Ole)\n- started gtk-doc changes\n- renamed im_meta_get_type() and im_header_get_type() as\n  im_meta_get_typeof() and im_header_get_typeof() to prevent confusion with\n  GObject type definers (was

for SetImageOption() so we work with GraphicsMagick too\n- \"header\" sets a non-zero exit code if anything failed\n- add and use im_check_uncoded() and friends\n- matlab load handles column-major and plane-separated images (thanks Mikhail)\n- JPEG save allows \"none\" for profile, meaning don't attach a profile\n- saner, simpler, faster typecasting for im_add(), im_subtract(),\n  im_multiply(), im_divide(), im_remainder()\n- im_remainder() has a float result for float types\n- im_measure() allows sel == NULL, meaning all patches\n- added \"deprecated\" package\n- faster, simpler, better im_max(), im_min, im_avg(), im_deviate()\n- im_max() returns true modulus, not square of modulus, for complex images\n- im_avg() works for complex, returning average modulus\n- im_system() fix (thanks Roland)\n- im_system() rewrite\n- im_maxpos()/im_minpos() are partial and work for complex\n- im_max()/im_min() are now convenience functions\n- im_maxpos_avg() handles complex and multi-band images\n- added im_point(), rewrite im_point_bilinear() in terms of this\n- close callbacks now happen *after* images have closed resources (such as\n  open files) ... this lets them delete temps and stuff. Expect breakage :(\n- added vips_interpolate_get_window_offset()\n- boolean revised: smaller, more general, faster\n- im_remainderconst_vec() renamed to im_remainder_vec() for consistency\n- added
