Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. The envoy common router will segfault if an internal redirect selects a route configured with direct response or redirect actions. This will result in a denial of service. As a workaround turn off internal redirects if direct response entries are configured on the same listener.
