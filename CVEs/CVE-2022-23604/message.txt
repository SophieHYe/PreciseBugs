x26-Cogs is a repository of cogs made by Twentysix for the Red Discord bot. Among these cogs is the Defender cog, a tool for Discord server moderation. A vulnerability in the Defender cog prior to version 1.10.0 allows users with admin privileges to issue commands as other users who share the same server. If a bot owner shares the same server as the attacker, it is possible for the attacker to issue bot-owner restricted commands. The issue has been patched in version 1.10.0. One may unload the Defender cog as a workaround.
