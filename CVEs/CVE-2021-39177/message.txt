Geyser is a bridge between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition. Versions of Geyser prior to 1.4.2-SNAPSHOT allow anyone that can connect to the server to forge a LoginPacket with manipulated JWT token allowing impersonation as any user. Version 1.4.2-SNAPSHOT contains a patch for the issue. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.
