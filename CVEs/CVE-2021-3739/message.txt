A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the btrfs_rm_device function in fs/btrfs/volumes.c in the Linux Kernel, where triggering the bug requires ‘CAP_SYS_ADMIN’. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash the system or leak kernel internal information. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.
