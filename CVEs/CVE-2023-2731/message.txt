A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in Libtiff's LZWDecode() function in the libtiff/tif_lzw.c file. This flaw allows a local attacker to craft specific input data that can cause the program to dereference a NULL pointer when decompressing a TIFF format file, resulting in a program crash or denial of service.
