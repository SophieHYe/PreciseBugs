BaserCMS is an open source content management system with a focus on Japanese language support. In affected versions users with upload privilege may upload crafted zip files capable of path traversal on the host operating system. This is a vulnerability that needs to be addressed when the management system is used by an unspecified number of users. If you are eligible, please update to the new version as soon as possible.
