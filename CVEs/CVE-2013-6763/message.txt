The uio_mmap_physical function in drivers/uio/uio.c in the Linux kernel before 3.12 does not validate the size of a memory block, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges via crafted mmap operations, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-4511.
