An error in the implementation of an autosubscribe feature in the check_stream_exists route of the Zulip group chat application server before 1.4.3 allowed an authenticated user to subscribe to a private stream that should have required an invitation from an existing member to join. The issue affects all previously released versions of the Zulip server.
