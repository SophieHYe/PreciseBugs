** DISPUTED ** Multiple integer overflows in the lzo1x_decompress_safe function in lib/lzo/lzo1x_decompress_safe.c in the LZO decompressor in the Linux kernel before 3.15.2 allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a crafted Literal Run.  NOTE: the author of the LZO algorithms says "the Linux kernel is *not* affected; media hype."
