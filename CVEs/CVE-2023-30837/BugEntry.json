Address literals must be written in hexadecimal notation with a leading ``0x`` and must be `checksummed <https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md>`_.\n\n.. _members-of-addresses:\n\nMembers\n^^^^^^^\n\n=============== =========== ==========================================================================\nMember          Type        Description\n=============== =========== ==========================================================================\n``balance``     ``uint256`` Balance of an address\n``codehash``    ``bytes32`` Keccak of code at an address, ``EMPTY_BYTES32`` if no contract is deployed\n``codesize``    ``uint256`` Size of code deployed at an address, in bytes\n``is_contract`` ``bool``    Boolean indicating if a contract is deployed at an address\n``code``        ``Bytes``   Contract bytecode\n=============== =========== ==========================================================================\n\nSyntax as follows: ``_address.<member>``, where ``_address`` is of the type ``address`` and ``<member>`` is one of the above keywords.\n\n.. note::\n\n    Operations such as ``SELFDESTRUCT`` and ``CREATE2`` allow for the removal and replacement of bytecode at an address. You should never assume that values of address members will not change in the future.\n\n.. note::\n\n    ``_address.code`` requires the usage of :func:`slice <slice>` to explicitly extract a section of contract bytecode. If the extracted section exceeds the bounds of bytecode, this will throw. You can check the size of ``_address.code`` using ``_address.codesize``.\n\nM-byte-wide Fixed Size Byte Array\n----------------------\n\n**Keyword:** ``bytesM``\nThis is an M-byte-wide byte array that is otherwise similar to dynamically sized byte arrays. On an ABI level, it is annotated as bytesM (e.g., bytes32).\n\n**Example:**\n::\n\n    # Declaration\n    hash: bytes32\n    # Assignment\n    self.hash = _hash\n\n    some_method_id: bytes4 = 0x01abcdef\n\nOperators\n*********\n\n====================================  ============================================================\nKeyword                               Description\n====================================  ============================================================\n``keccak256(x)``                      Return the keccak256 hash as bytes32.\n``concat(x, ...)``                    Concatenate multiple inputs.\n``slice(x, start=_start, len=_len)``  Return a slice of ``_len`` starting at ``_start``.\n====================================  ============================================================\n\nWhere ``x`` is a byte array and ``_start`` as well as ``_len`` are integer values.\n\n.. index:: !bytes\n\nByte Arrays\n-----------\n\n**Keyword:** ``Bytes``\n\nA byte array with a max size.\n\nThe syntax being ``Bytes[maxLen]``, where ``maxLen`` is an integer which denotes the maximum number of bytes.\nOn the ABI level the Fixed-size bytes array is annotated as ``bytes``.\n\nBytes literals may be given as bytes strings.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    bytes_string: Bytes[100] = b\"\\x01\"\n\n.. index:: !string\n\nStrings\n-------\n\n**Keyword:** ``String``\n\nFixed-size strings can hold strings with equal or fewer characters than the maximum length of the string.\nOn the ABI level the Fixed-size bytes array is annotated as ``string``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    example_str: String[100] = \"Test String\"\n\nEnums\n-----\n\n**Keyword:** ``enum``\n\nEnums are custom defined types. An enum must have at least one member, and can hold up to a maximum of 256 members.\nThe members are represented by ``uint256`` values in the form of 2\\ :sup:`n` where ``n`` is the index of the member in the range ``0 <= n <= 255``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Defining an enum with two members\n    enum Roles:\n        ADMIN\n        USER\n\n    # Declaring an enum variable\n    role: Roles = Roles.ADMIN\n\n    # Returning a member\n    return Roles.ADMIN\n\nOperators\n*********\n\nComparisons\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nComparisons return a boolean value.\n\n============== ================\nOperator       Description\n============== ================\n``x == y``     Equals\n``x != y``     Does not equal\n``x in y``     x is in y\n``x not in y`` x is not in y\n============== ================\n\nBitwise Operators\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n=============  ======================\nOperator       Description\n=============  ======================\n``x & y``      Bitwise and\n``x | y``      Bitwise or\n``x ^ y``      Bitwise xor\n``~x``         Bitwise not\n=============  ======================\n\nEnum members can be combined using the above bitwise operators. While enum members have values that are power of two, enum member combinations may not.\n\nThe ``in`` and ``not in`` operators can be used in conjunction with enum member combinations to check for membership.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    enum Roles:\n        MANAGER\n        ADMIN\n        USER\n\n    # Check for membership\n    @external\n    def foo(a: Roles) -> bool:\n        return a in (Roles.MANAGER | Roles.USER)\n\n    # Check not in\n    @external\n    def bar(a: Roles) -> bool:\n        return a not in (Roles.MANAGER | Roles.USER)\n\nNote that ``in`` is not the same as strict equality (``==``). ``in`` checks that *any* of the flags on two enum objects are simultaneously set, while ``==`` checks that two enum objects are bit-for-bit equal.\n\nThe following code uses bitwise operations to add and revoke permissions from a given ``Roles`` object.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n    @external\n    def add_user(a: Roles) -> Roles:\n        ret: Roles = a\n        ret |= Roles.USER  # set the USER bit to 1\n        return ret\n\n    @external\n    def revoke_user(a: Roles) -> Roles:\n        ret: Roles = a\n        ret &= ~Roles.USER  # set the USER bit to 0\n        return ret\n\n    @external\n    def flip_user(a: Roles) -> Roles:\n        ret: Roles = a\n        ret ^= Roles.USER  # flip the user bit between 0 and 1\n        return ret\n\n.. index:: !reference\n\nReference Types\n===============\n\nReference types are those whose components can be assigned to in-place without copying. For instance, array and struct members can be individually assigned to without overwriting the whole data structure.\n\n.. note::\n\n  In terms of the calling convention, reference types are passed by value, not by reference. That means that, a calling function does not need to worry about a callee modifying the data of a passed structure.\n\n.. index:: !arrays\n\nFixed-size Lists\n----------------\n\nFixed-size lists hold a finite number of elements which belong to a specified type.\n\nLists can be declared with ``_name: _ValueType[_Integer]``, except ``Bytes[N]``, ``String[N]`` and enums.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Defining a list\n    exampleList: int128[3]\n\n    # Setting values\n    exampleList = [10, 11, 12]\n    exampleList[2] = 42\n\n    # Returning a value\n    return exampleList[0]\n\nMultidimensional lists are also possible. The notation for the declaration is reversed compared to some other languages, but the access notation is not reversed.\n\nA two dimensional list can be declared with ``_name: _ValueType[inner_size][outer_size]``. Elements can be accessed with ``_name[outer_index][inner_index]``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Defining a list with 2 rows and 5 columns and set all values to 0\n    exampleList2D: int128[5][2] = empty(int128[5][2])\n\n    # Setting a value for row the first row (0) and last column (4)\n    exampleList2D[0][4] = 42\n\n    # Setting values\n    exampleList2D = [[10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]\n\n    # Returning the value in row 0 column 4 (in this case 14)\n    return exampleList2D[0][4]\n\n.. index:: !dynarrays\n\nDynamic Arrays\n----------------\n\nDynamic arrays represent bounded arrays whose length can be modified at runtime, up to a bound specified in the type. They can be declared with ``_name: DynArray[_Type, _Integer]``, where ``_Type`` can be of value type or reference type (except mappings).\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Defining a list\n    exampleList: DynArray[int128, 3]\n\n    # Setting values\n    exampleList = []\n    # exampleList.pop()  # would revert!\n    exampleList.append(42)  # exampleList now has length 1\n    exampleList.append(120)  # exampleList now has length 2\n    exampleList.append(356)  # exampleList now has length 3\n    # exampleList.append(1)  # would revert!\n\n    myValue: int128 = exampleList.pop()  # myValue == 356, exampleList now has length 2\n\n    # myValue = exampleList[2]  # would revert!\n\n    # Returning a value\n    return exampleList[0]\n\n\n.. note::\n    Attempting to access data past the runtime length of an array, ``pop()`` an empty array or ``append()`` to a full array will result in a runtime ``REVERT``. Attempting to pass an array in calldata which is larger than the array bound will result in a runtime ``REVERT``.\n\n.. note::\n    To keep code easy to reason about, modifying an array while using it as an iterator is disallowed by the language. For instance, the following usage is not allowed:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        for item in self.my_array:\n            self.my_array[0] = item\n\nIn the ABI, they are represented as ``_Type[]``. For instance, ``DynArray[int128, 3]`` gets represented as ``int128[]``, and ``DynArray[DynArray[int128, 3], 3]`` gets represented as ``int128[][]``.\n\n.. _types-struct:\n\nStructs\n-------\n\nStructs are custom defined types that can group several variables.\n\nStruct types can be used inside mappings and arrays. Structs can contain arrays and other structs, but not mappings.\n\nStruct members can be accessed via ``struct.argname``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Defining a struct\n    struct MyStruct:\n        value1: int128\n        value2: decimal\n\n    # Declaring a struct variable\n    exampleStruct: MyStruct = MyStruct({value1: 1, value2: 2.0})\n\n    # Accessing a value\n    exampleStruct.value1 = 1\n\n.. index:: !mapping\n\nMappings\n--------\n\nMappings are `hash tables <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table>`_ that are virtually initialized such that every possible key exists and is mapped to a value whose byte-representation is all zeros: a type's :ref:`default value <types-initial>`.\n\nThe key data is not stored in a mapping. Instead, its ``keccak256`` hash is used to look up a value. For this reason, mappings do not have a length or a concept of a key or value being \"set\".\n\nMapping types are declared as ``HashMap[_KeyType, _ValueType]``.\n\n* ``_KeyType`` can be any base or bytes type. Mappings, arrays or structs are not supported as key types.\n* ``_ValueType`` can actually be any type, including mappings.\n\n.. note::\n    Mappings are only allowed as state variables.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   # Defining a mapping\n   exampleMapping: HashMap[int128, decimal]\n\n   # Accessing a value\n   exampleMapping[0] = 10.1\n\n.. note::\n\n    Mappings have no concept of length and so cannot be iterated over.\n\n.. index:: !initial\n\n.. _types-initial:\n\nInitial Values\n==============\n\nUnlike most programming languages, Vyper does not have a concept of ``null``. Instead, every variable type has a default value. To check if a variable is empty, you must compare it to the default value for its given type.\n\nTo reset a variable to its default value, assign to it the built-in ``empty()`` function which constructs a zero value for that type.\n\n.. note::\n\n    Memory variables must be assigned a value at the time they are declared.\n\nHere you can find a list of all types and default values:\n\n=========== ======================================================================\nType        Default Value\n=========== ======================================================================\n``address`` ``0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000``\n``bool``    ``False``\n``bytes32`` ``0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000``\n``decimal`` ``0.0``\n``uint8``   ``0``\n``int128``  ``0``\n``int256``  ``0``\n``uint256`` ``0``\n=========== ======================================================================\n\n.. note::\n    In ``Bytes``, the array starts with the bytes all set to ``'\\x00'``.\n\n.. note::\n    In reference types, all the type's members are set to their initial values.\n\n\n.. _type_conversions:\n\nType Conversions\n================\n\nAll type conversions in Vyper must be made explicitly using the built-in ``convert(a: atype, btype)`` function. Type conversions in Vyper are designed to be safe and intuitive. All type conversions will check that the input is in bounds for the output type. The general principles are:\n\n* Except for conversions involving decimals and bools, the input is bit-for-bit preserved.\n* Conversions to bool map all nonzero inputs to 1.\n* When converting from decimals to integers, the input is truncated towards zero.\n* ``address`` types are treated as ``uint160``, except conversions with signed integers and decimals are not allowed.\n* Converting between right-padded (``bytes``, ``Bytes``, ``String``) and left-padded types, results in a rotation to convert the padding. For instance, converting from ``bytes20`` to ``address`` would result in rotating the input by 12 bytes to the right.\n* Converting between signed and unsigned integers reverts if the input is negative.\n* Narrowing conversions (e.g., ``int256 -> int128``) check that the input is in bounds for the output type.\n* Converting between bytes and int types results in sign-extension if the output type is signed. For instance, converting ``0xff`` (``bytes1``) to ``int8`` returns ``-1``.\n* Converting between bytes and int types which have different sizes follows the rule of going through the closest integer type, first. For instance, ``bytes1 -> int16`` is like ``bytes1 -> int8 -> int16`` (signextend, then widen). ``uint8 -> bytes20`` is like ``uint8 -> uint160 -> bytes20`` (rotate left 12 bytes).\n* Enums can be converted to and from ``uint256`` only.\n\nA small Python reference implementation is maintained as part of Vyper's test suite, it can be found `here <https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/c4c6afd07801a0cc0038cdd4007cc43860c54193/tests/parser/functions/test_convert.py#L318>`_.

On an ABI level, it is annotated as bytesM (e.g., bytes32).\n\n**Example:**\n::\n\n    # Declaration\n    hash: bytes32\n    # Assignment\n    self.hash = _hash\n\n    some_method_id: bytes4 = 0x01abcdef\n\nOperators\n*********\n\n====================================  ============================================================\nKeyword                               Description\n====================================  ============================================================\n``keccak256(x)``                      Return the keccak256 hash as bytes32.\n``concat(x, ...)``                    Concatenate multiple inputs.\n``slice(x, start=_start, len=_len)``  Return a slice of ``_len`` starting at ``_start``.\n====================================  ============================================================\n\nWhere ``x`` is a byte array and ``_start`` as well as ``_len`` are integer values.\n\n.. index:: !bytes\n\nByte Arrays\n-----------\n\n**Keyword:** ``Bytes``\n\nA byte array with a max size.\n\nThe syntax being ``Bytes[maxLen]``, where ``maxLen`` is an integer which denotes the maximum number of bytes.\nOn the ABI level the Fixed-size bytes array is annotated as ``bytes``.\n\nBytes literals may be given as bytes strings.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    bytes_string: Bytes[100] = b\"\\x01\"\n\n.. index:: !string\n\nStrings\n-------\n\n**Keyword:** ``String``\n\nFixed-size strings can hold strings with equal or fewer characters than the maximum length of the string.\nOn the ABI level the Fixed-size bytes array is annotated as ``string``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    example_str: String[100] = \"Test String\"\n\nEnums\n-----\n\n**Keyword:** ``enum``\n\nEnums are custom defined types. An enum must have at least one member, and can hold up to a maximum of 256 members.\nThe members are represented by ``uint256`` values in the form of 2\\ :sup:`n` where ``n`` is the index of the member in the range ``0 <= n <= 255``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Defining an enum with two members\n    enum Roles:\n        ADMIN\n        USER\n\n    # Declaring an enum variable\n    role: Roles = Roles.ADMIN\n\n    # Returning a member\n    return Roles.ADMIN\n\nOperators\n*********\n\nComparisons\n^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nComparisons return a boolean value.\n\n============== ================\nOperator       Description\n============== ================\n``x == y``     Equals\n``x != y``     Does not equal\n``x in y``     x is in y\n``x not in y`` x is not in y\n============== ================\n\nBitwise Operators\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n=============  ======================\nOperator       Description\n=============  ======================\n``x & y``      Bitwise and\n``x | y``      Bitwise or\n``x ^ y``      Bitwise xor\n``~x``         Bitwise not\n=============  ======================\n\nEnum members can be combined using the above bitwise operators. While enum members have values that are power of two, enum member combinations may not.\n\nThe ``in`` and ``not in`` operators can be used in conjunction with enum member combinations to check for membership.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    enum Roles:\n        MANAGER\n        ADMIN\n        USER\n\n    # Check for membership\n    @external\n    def foo(a: Roles) -> bool:\n        return a in (Roles.MANAGER | Roles.USER)\n\n    # Check not in\n    @external\n    def bar(a: Roles) -> bool:\n        return a not in (Roles.MANAGER | Roles.USER)\n\nNote that ``in`` is not the same as strict equality (``==``). ``in`` checks that *any* of the flags on two enum objects are simultaneously set, while ``==`` checks that two enum objects are bit-for-bit equal.\n\nThe following code uses bitwise operations to add and revoke permissions from a given ``Roles`` object.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n    @external\n    def add_user(a: Roles) -> Roles:\n        ret: Roles = a\n        ret |= Roles.USER  # set the USER bit to 1\n        return ret\n\n    @external\n    def revoke_user(a: Roles) -> Roles:\n        ret: Roles = a\n        ret &= ~Roles.USER  # set the USER bit to 0\n        return ret\n\n    @external\n    def flip_user(a: Roles) -> Roles:\n        ret: Roles = a\n        ret ^= Roles.USER  # flip the user bit between 0 and 1\n        return ret\n\n.. index:: !reference\n\nReference Types\n===============\n\nReference types are those whose components can be assigned to in-place without copying. For instance, array and struct members can be individually assigned to without overwriting the whole data structure.\n\n.. note::\n\n  In terms of the calling convention, reference types are passed by value, not by reference. That means that, a calling function does not need to worry about a callee modifying the data of a passed structure.\n\n.. index:: !arrays\n\nFixed-size Lists\n----------------\n\nFixed-size lists hold a finite number of elements which belong to a specified type.\n\nLists can be declared with ``_name: _ValueType[_Integer]``, except ``Bytes[N]``, ``String[N]`` and enums.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Defining a list\n    exampleList: int128[3]\n\n    # Setting values\n    exampleList = [10, 11, 12]\n    exampleList[2] = 42\n\n    # Returning a value\n    return exampleList[0]\n\nMultidimensional lists are also possible. The notation for the declaration is reversed compared to some other languages, but the access notation is not reversed.\n\nA two dimensional list can be declared with ``_name: _ValueType[inner_size][outer_size]``. Elements can be accessed with ``_name[outer_index][inner_index]``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Defining a list with 2 rows and 5 columns and set all values to 0\n    exampleList2D: int128[5][2] = empty(int128[5][2])\n\n    # Setting a value for row the first row (0) and last column (4)\n    exampleList2D[0][4] = 42\n\n    # Setting values\n    exampleList2D = [[10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]\n\n    # Returning the value in row 0 column 4 (in this case 14)\n    return exampleList2D[0][4]\n\n.. note::\n    Defining an array in storage whose size is significantly larger than ``2**64`` can result in security vulnerabilities due to risk of overflow.\n\n.. index:: !dynarrays\n\nDynamic Arrays\n----------------\n\nDynamic arrays represent bounded arrays whose length can be modified at runtime, up to a bound specified in the type. They can be declared with ``_name: DynArray[_Type, _Integer]``, where ``_Type`` can be of value type or reference type (except mappings).\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Defining a list\n    exampleList: DynArray[int128, 3]\n\n    # Setting values\n    exampleList = []\n    # exampleList.pop()  # would revert!\n    exampleList.append(42)  # exampleList now has length 1\n    exampleList.append(120)  # exampleList now has length 2\n    exampleList.append(356)  # exampleList now has length 3\n    # exampleList.append(1)  # would revert!\n\n    myValue: int128 = exampleList.pop()  # myValue == 356, exampleList now has length 2\n\n    # myValue = exampleList[2]  # would revert!\n\n    # Returning a value\n    return exampleList[0]\n\n\n.. note::\n    Attempting to access data past the runtime length of an array, ``pop()`` an empty array or ``append()`` to a full array will result in a runtime ``REVERT``. Attempting to pass an array in calldata which is larger than the array bound will result in a runtime ``REVERT``.\n\n.. note::\n    To keep code easy to reason about, modifying an array while using it as an iterator is disallowed by the language. For instance, the following usage is not allowed:\n\n    .. code-block:: python\n\n        for item in self.my_array:\n            self.my_array[0] = item\n\nIn the ABI, they are represented as ``_Type[]``. For instance, ``DynArray[int128, 3]`` gets represented as ``int128[]``, and ``DynArray[DynArray[int128, 3], 3]`` gets represented as ``int128[][]``.\n\n.. note::\n    Defining a dynamic array in storage whose size is significantly larger than ``2**64`` can result in security vulnerabilities due to risk of overflow.\n\n\n.. _types-struct:\n\nStructs\n-------\n\nStructs are custom defined types that can group several variables.\n\nStruct types can be used inside mappings and arrays. Structs can contain arrays and other structs, but not mappings.\n\nStruct members can be accessed via ``struct.argname``.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # Defining a struct\n    struct MyStruct:\n        value1: int128\n        value2: decimal\n\n    # Declaring a struct variable\n    exampleStruct: MyStruct = MyStruct({value1: 1, value2: 2.0})\n\n    # Accessing a value\n    exampleStruct.value1 = 1\n\n.. index:: !mapping\n\nMappings\n--------\n\nMappings are `hash tables <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table>`_ that are virtually initialized such that every possible key exists and is mapped to a value whose byte-representation is all zeros: a type's :ref:`default value <types-initial>`.\n\nThe key data is not stored in a mapping. Instead, its ``keccak256`` hash is used to look up a value. For this reason, mappings do not have a length or a concept of a key or value being \"set\".\n\nMapping types are declared as ``HashMap[_KeyType, _ValueType]``.\n\n* ``_KeyType`` can be any base or bytes type. Mappings, arrays or structs are not supported as key types.\n* ``_ValueType`` can actually be any type, including mappings.\n\n.. note::\n    Mappings are only allowed as state variables.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n   # Defining a mapping\n   exampleMapping: HashMap[int128, decimal]\n\n   # Accessing a value\n   exampleMapping[0] = 10.1\n\n.. note::\n\n    Mappings have no concept of length and so cannot be iterated over.\n\n.. index:: !initial\n\n.. _types-initial:\n\nInitial Values\n==============\n\nUnlike most programming languages, Vyper does not have a concept of ``null``. Instead, every variable type has a default value. To check if a variable is empty, you must compare it to the default value for its given type.\n\nTo reset a variable to its default value, assign to it the built-in ``empty()`` function which constructs a zero value for that type.\n\n.. note::\n\n    Memory variables must be assigned a value at the time they are declared.\n\nHere you can find a list of all types and default values:\n\n=========== ======================================================================\nType        Default Value\n=========== ======================================================================\n``address`` ``0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000``\n``bool``    ``False``\n``bytes32`` ``0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000``\n``decimal`` ``0.0``\n``uint8``   ``0``\n``int128``  ``0``\n``int256``  ``0``\n``uint256`` ``0``\n=========== ======================================================================\n\n.. note::\n    In ``Bytes``, the array starts with the bytes all set to ``'\\x00'``.\n\n.. note::\n    In reference types, all the type's members are set to their initial values.\n\n\n.. _type_conversions:\n\nType Conversions\n================\n\nAll type conversions in Vyper must be made explicitly using the built-in ``convert(a: atype, btype)`` function. Type conversions in Vyper are designed to be safe and intuitive. All type conversions will check that the input is in bounds for the output type. The general principles are:\n\n* Except for conversions involving decimals and bools, the input is bit-for-bit preserved.\n* Conversions to bool map all nonzero inputs to 1.\n* When converting from decimals to integers, the input is truncated towards zero.\n* ``address`` types are treated as ``uint160``, except conversions with signed integers and decimals are not allowed.\n* Converting between right-padded (``bytes``, ``Bytes``, ``String``) and left-padded types, results in a rotation to convert the padding. For instance, converting from ``bytes20`` to ``address`` would result in rotating the input by 12 bytes to the right.\n* Converting between signed and unsigned integers reverts if the input is negative.\n* Narrowing conversions (e.g., ``int256 -> int128``) check that the input is in bounds for the output type.\n* Converting between bytes and int types results in sign-extension if the output type is signed. For instance, converting ``0xff`` (``bytes1``) to ``int8`` returns ``-1``.\n* Converting between bytes and int types which have different sizes follows the rule of going through the closest integer type, first. For instance, ``bytes1 -> int16`` is like ``bytes1 -> int8 -> int16`` (signextend, then widen). ``uint8 -> bytes20`` is like ``uint8 -> uint160 -> bytes20`` (rotate left 12 bytes).\n* Enums can be converted to and from ``uint256`` only.\n\nA small Python reference implementation is maintained as part of Vyper's test suite, it can be found `here <https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/blob/c4c6afd07801a0cc0038cdd4007cc43860c54193/tests/parser/functions/test_convert.py#L318>`_.
