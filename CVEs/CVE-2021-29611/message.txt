TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. Incomplete validation in `SparseReshape` results in a denial of service based on a `CHECK`-failure. The implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e87b51ce05c3eb172065a6ea5f48415854223285/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_reshape_op.cc#L40) has no validation that the input arguments specify a valid sparse tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are the only affected versions.
