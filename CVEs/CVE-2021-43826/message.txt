Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-native applications. In affected versions of Envoy a crash occurs when configured for :ref:`upstream tunneling <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.network.tcp_proxy.v3.TcpProxy.tunneling_config>` and the downstream connection disconnects while the the upstream connection or http/2 stream is still being established. There are no workarounds for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.
