** DISPUTED ** Integer signedness error in the pmcraid_ioctl_passthrough function in drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c in the Linux kernel before 3.1 might allow local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or memory corruption) via a negative size value in an ioctl call. NOTE: this may be a vulnerability only in unusual environments that provide a privileged program for obtaining the required file descriptor.
