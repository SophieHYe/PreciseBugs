An issue was discovered in MISP 2.4.9x before 2.4.99. In app/Model/Event.php (the STIX 1 import code), an unescaped filename string is used to construct a shell command. This vulnerability can be abused by a malicious authenticated user to execute arbitrary commands by tweaking the original filename of the STIX import.
