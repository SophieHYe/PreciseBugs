We believe that you shouldn't have to hire a developer to create a WordPress gallery. That's why we built [Envira](https://bit.ly/35gNvqW), a drag & drop **photo gallery plugin** that's both EASY, FAST and POWERFUL.

Envira Gallery is optimized for web and server performance as well as SEO and conversion, because we understand the importance of speed when it comes to image and gallery load times. Especially if your looking to sell from your site.

Works great with the top page builders including: Elementor, Beaver Builder, Divi and more.

= Drag & Drop Gallery Builder =

We were tired with the bloated and buggy gallery widgets. That's why we built Envira Gallery to adapt to your workflow and allow you to create in minutes. By using our easy to use [drag and drop builder](https://bit.ly/3bObn87), you can upload your photos, rearrange them, and create an image gallery with just a few clicks.

You can also add gallery blocks built for the Gutenberg block editor.

= Easy to Customize and Extend =

You can easily customize with our built-in Wordpress templates and layouts or create your own.

But we also knew that our developer friends may want to extend it further. That's why Envira comes with tons of hooks and filters (and yes it's all very-well documented).

> Most WordPress gallery options are either too basic or require a PhD to figure out. For my clients, I need something that is easy to use yet powerful. Envira is the answer. Its straight forward approach means it is a breeze for my clients to quickly create galleries. Nevertheless, with the API and documentation available, it also allows developers to make customizations and extend functionality when necessary.
