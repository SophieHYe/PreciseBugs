XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. In versions prior to 12.6.7 and 12.10.3, a user without Script or Programming right is able to execute script requiring privileges by editing gadget titles in the dashboard. The issue has been patched in XWiki 12.6.7, 12.10.3 and 13.0RC1.
