** DISPUTED ** In Supervisor through 4.0.2, an unauthenticated user can read log files or restart a service. Note: The maintainer responded that the affected component, inet_http_server, is not enabled by default but if the user enables it and does not set a password, Supervisor logs a warning message. The maintainer indicated the ability to run an open server will not be removed but an additional warning was added to the documentation.
