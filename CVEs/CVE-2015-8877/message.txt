The gdImageScaleTwoPass function in gd_interpolation.c in the GD Graphics Library (aka libgd) before 2.2.0, as used in PHP before 5.6.12, uses inconsistent allocate and free approaches, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted call, as demonstrated by a call to the PHP imagescale function.
