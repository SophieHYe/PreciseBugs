The nfs_can_extend_write function in fs/nfs/write.c in the Linux kernel before 3.13.3 relies on a write delegation to extend a write operation without a certain up-to-date verification, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory in opportunistic circumstances by writing to a file in an NFS filesystem and then reading the same file.
