Botan 2.5.0 through 2.6.0 before 2.7.0 allows a memory-cache side-channel attack on ECDSA signatures, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number Problem or ROHNP, related to dsa/dsa.cpp, ec_group/ec_group.cpp, and ecdsa/ecdsa.cpp. To discover an ECDSA key, the attacker needs access to either the local machine or a different virtual machine on the same physical host.
