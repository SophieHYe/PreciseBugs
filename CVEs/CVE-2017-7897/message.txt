A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the MantisBT (2.3.x before 2.3.2) Timeline include page, used in My View (my_view_page.php) and User Information (view_user_page.php) pages, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code (if CSP settings permit it) through crafted PATH_INFO in a URL, due to use of unsanitized $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] to generate URLs.
