Roblox-Purchasing-Hub is an open source Roblox product purchasing hub. A security risk in versions 1.0.1 and prior allowed people who have someone's API URL to get product files without an API key. This issue is fixed in version 1.0.2. As a workaround, add `@require_apikey` in `BOT/lib/cogs/website.py` under the route for `/v1/products`.
