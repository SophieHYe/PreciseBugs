mangadex-downloader is a command-line tool to download manga from MangaDex. When using `file:<location>` command and `<location>` is a web URL location (http, https), mangadex-downloader between versions 1.3.0 and 1.7.2 will try to open and read a file in local disk for each line of website contents. Version 1.7.2 contains a patch for this issue.
