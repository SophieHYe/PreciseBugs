A packet of death scenario is possible in mvfst via a specially crafted message during a QUIC session, which causes a crash via a failed assertion. Per QUIC specification, this particular message should be treated as a connection error. This issue affects mvfst versions prior to commit a67083ff4b8dcbb7ee2839da6338032030d712b0 and proxygen versions prior to v2021.03.15.00.
