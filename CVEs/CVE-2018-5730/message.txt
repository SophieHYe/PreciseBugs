MIT krb5 1.6 or later allows an authenticated kadmin with permission to add principals to an LDAP Kerberos database to circumvent a DN containership check by supplying both a "linkdn" and "containerdn" database argument, or by supplying a DN string which is a left extension of a container DN string but is not hierarchically within the container DN.
