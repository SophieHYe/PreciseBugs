Tweak a few of the WooFramework's filters and features, via a neat interface.

== Description ==

Using WooFramework Tweaks, it's possible to tweak a few of the filters in WooFramework version 6 or higher, via a neat interface which slots right in with the WooFramework.

Looking for a helping hand? [View plugin documentation](http://docs.woothemes.com/document/wooframework-tweaks/).

== Usage ==

Once activated, a "Tweaks" menu item will display underneath the WooThemes administration menu. If you're not using a WooThemes theme, this menu will display under the "Appearance" menu item.

Once done, click the "Save Changes" button, to save and apply your settings.
