** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** An issue was discovered in ReadyTalk Avian 1.2.0 before 2020-10-27. The FileOutputStream.write() method in FileOutputStream.java has a boundary check to prevent out-of-bounds memory read/write operations. However, an integer overflow leads to bypassing this check and achieving the out-of-bounds access. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.
