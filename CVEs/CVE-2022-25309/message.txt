A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Fribidi package and affects the fribidi_cap_rtl_to_unicode() function of the fribidi-char-sets-cap-rtl.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to pass a specially crafted file to the Fribidi application with the '--caprtl' option, leading to a crash and causing a denial of service.
