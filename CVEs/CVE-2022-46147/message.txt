Drag and Drop XBlock v2 implements a drag-and-drop style problem, where a learner has to drag items to zones on a target image. Versions prior to 3.0.0 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting in multiple XBlock Fields. Any platform that has deployed the XBlock may be impacted. Version 3.0.0 contains a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.
