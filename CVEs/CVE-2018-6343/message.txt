Proxygen fails to validate that a secondary auth manager is set before dereferencing it. That can cause a denial of service issue when parsing a Certificate/CertificateRequest HTTP2 Frame over a fizz (TLS 1.3) transport. This issue affects Proxygen releases starting from v2018.10.29.00 until the fix in v2018.11.19.00.
