Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior to version 2.8.4 on the `stable` branch and 2.9.0beta5 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, inviting users on sites that use single sign-on could bypass the `must_approve_users` check and invites by staff are always approved automatically. The issue is patched in Discourse version 2.8.4 on the `stable` branch and version `2.9.0.beta5` on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, disable invites or increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.
