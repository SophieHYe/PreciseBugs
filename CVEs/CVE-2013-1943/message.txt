The KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.0 does not check whether kernel addresses are specified during allocation of memory slots for use in a guest's physical address space, which allows local users to gain privileges or obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted application, related to arch/x86/kvm/paging_tmpl.h and virt/kvm/kvm_main.c.
