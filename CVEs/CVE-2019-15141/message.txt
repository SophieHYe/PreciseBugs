WriteTIFFImage in coders/tiff.c in ImageMagick 7.0.8-43 Q16 allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service (application crash resulting from a heap-based buffer over-read) via a crafted TIFF image file, related to TIFFRewriteDirectory, TIFFWriteDirectory, TIFFWriteDirectorySec, and TIFFWriteDirectoryTagColormap in tif_dirwrite.c of LibTIFF. NOTE: this occurs because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-11597.
