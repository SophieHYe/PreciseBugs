The Editorial Calendar makes it possible to see all your posts and drag and drop them to manage your blog.

== Description ==

Did you remember to write a post for next Tuesday?  What about the Tuesday after that?  WordPress doesn't make it easy to see when your posts are scheduled.  The editorial calendar gives you an overview of your blog and when each post will be published.  You can drag and drop to move posts, edit posts right in the calendar, and manage your entire blog.

<a href="http://websuccessdiva.com/seo-copywriting-checklist/">SEO Copywriting Checklist for Wordpress Blogs</a> on <a href="http://websuccessdiva.com/">@WebSuccessDiva</a> is a good article about SEO and using an editorial calendar.

= Can I see a demo of the calendar? =

Check out our demo installation at <a href="http://www.zackgrossbart.com/extras/sandbox/wp-admin/edit.php?page=cal">Zack's WordPress Sandbox</a>.

= How do I get help using the calendar? =

The <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/wp-edcal">WordPress Editorial Calendar Google Group</a> is a good place to ask questions, find answers, and post feedback.  We also follow the WordPress.org forum <a href="http://wordpress.org/tags/editorial-calendar?forum_id=10">Editorial Calendar discussion</a>. 

= How do I navigate in the calendar? =

You can move around in the calendar using the arrows next to the months at the top or your mouse wheel. You can also move using your keyboard:

<ul>
<li>Move 1 week into the past - Up Arrow</li>
<li>Move 1 week into the future - Down Arrow</li>
<li>Jump multiple weeks into the past - Page Up or Ctrl+Up Arrow</li>
<li>Jump multiple weeks into the future - Page Down or Ctrl+Down Arrow</li>
</ul>

= How do I change the first day of the week? =

The editorial calendar follows the Week Starts On preference on the WordPress General Settings page.  Choose the day you want and the calendar will use that day as the first day of the week.

= What languages does the calendar support? =

The calendar is available in Brazilian Portuguese, Croatian, Czech, Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Polish, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish. 

= Can I add new languages? =

Yes please!  We are looking for translators.  It only takes about 20 minutes.  If you're interested please <a href="mailto:wp-edcal@googlegroups.com">contact us</a>.

= How does the calendar work =

The calendar is written in JavaScript.  It contacts your blog when it scrolls to get data about your posts.  Just like Google Maps.  <a href="http://www.zackgrossbart.com/hackito/edcal/">Creating a JQuery Powered Posts Calendar for WordPress</a> explains a lot of the technical details.

= Is the calendar collecting data about my blog? =

After you use the calendar a few times we'll prompt you to let us collect a little data about your blog.  Information like the size of your browser window and the number of posts you have per day help us make the calendar even better.

The collected data is all available to the public.  Check out the <a href="http://www.zackgrossbart.com/edcal/mint/">Editorial Calendar Statistics</a>.

= What users can use the calendar? =

The editorial calendar works differently based on your permissions.  

* Administrators and Editors can use every feature available in the calendar.  
* Authors can use the calendar to edit, move, and publish their own posts, but other people's posts are read-only.  
* Contributors see everyone's posts and move their own posts, but can only save drafts.
* Subscribers can't see the calendar.

You can see how it looks for different users on our <a href="http://www.zackgrossbart.com/extras/sandbox/wp-admin/edit.php?page=cal">Zack's WordPress Sandbox</a> with the following users:

* edgar the Editor
* alice the Author
* conrad the Contributor
* sam the Subscriber

Each of these users has the password test.

= Can I use the editorial calendar with pages? =

Right now the calendar only supports posts.  We're considering adding pages.  If you would like to see pages show up in the calendar let us know.

= Does the calendar support group blogs? =

If your blog has multiple authors the calendar will work just fine.  You can show author names right in the calendar.  Just look under screen options.

We are currently working on new features for multi-author blogs.  If you have any ideas please <a href="mailto:wp-edcal@googlegroups.com">contact us</a>.

= Can my readers tell I'm using the editorial calendar? =

No.  The calendar is only an administration tool.  None of your readers will know you're running it unless you tell them.

= Why can't I move published posts? =

Moving published posts can cause problems with some RSS feeds and is generally not a very popular thing to do.  The calendar only allows you to move scheduled and draft posts.

== Screenshots ==

1. The calendar integrates seamlessly into the WordPress administration console
2. See the big picture with a view of all your posts and when they'll be published.
3. Drag and drop posts to easily change dates and take control of your blog.
4. Create, edit, and schedule posts in one simple quickedit dialog.
5. Show as much or as little of your blog as you like.
6. Use a special calendar for each custom post type on your blog.
7. Use the new unscheduled drafts section to manage drafts before you schedule them.

== Changelog ==

= 2.7 =

The calendar is now more careful about PHP warnings so it still works if the blog is set to show PHP warnings.

Added a namespace to fix a small issue of potential JavaScript file conflict with wp_enqueue_script().

= 2.1 =

The calendar now moves posts from the drafts drawer to the main calendar properly on blogs with the alternate functionality of the date function.
