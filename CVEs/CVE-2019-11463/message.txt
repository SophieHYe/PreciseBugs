A memory leak in archive_read_format_zip_cleanup in archive_read_support_format_zip.c in libarchive 3.3.4-dev allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted ZIP file because of a HAVE_LZMA_H typo. NOTE: this only affects users who downloaded the development code from GitHub. Users of the product's official releases are unaffected.
