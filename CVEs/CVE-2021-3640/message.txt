A flaw use-after-free in function sco_sock_sendmsg() of the Linux kernel HCI subsystem was found in the way user calls ioct UFFDIO_REGISTER or other way triggers race condition of the call sco_conn_del() together with the call sco_sock_sendmsg() with the expected controllable faulting memory page. A privileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
