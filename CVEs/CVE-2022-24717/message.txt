ssr-pages is an HTML page builder for the purpose of server-side rendering (SSR). In versions prior to 0.1.5, a cross site scripting (XSS) issue can occur when providing untrusted input to the `redirect.link` property as an argument to the `build(MessagePageOptions)` function. While there is no known workaround at this time, there is a patch in version 0.1.5.
