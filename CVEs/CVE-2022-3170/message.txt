An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the Linux kernel sound subsystem. It could occur when the 'id->name' provided by the user did not end with '\0'. A privileged local user could pass a specially crafted name through ioctl() interface and crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.
