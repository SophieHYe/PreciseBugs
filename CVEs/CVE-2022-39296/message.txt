MelisAssetManager provides deliveries of Melis Platform's assets located in every module's public folder. Attackers can read arbitrary files on affected versions of `melisplatform/melis-asset-manager`, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information. Conducting this attack does not require authentication. Users should immediately upgrade to `melisplatform/melis-asset-manager` >= 5.0.1. This issue was addressed by restricting access to files to intended directories only.
