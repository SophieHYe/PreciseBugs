Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms. Prior to versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1, the cookie consent page in Open Forms contains an open redirect by injecting a `referer` querystring parameter and failing to validate the value. A malicious actor is able to redirect users to a website under their control, opening them up for phishing attacks. The redirect is initiated by the open forms backend which is a legimate page, making it less obvious to end users they are being redirected to a malicious website. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. There are no known workarounds avaialble.
