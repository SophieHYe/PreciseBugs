Integer signedness error in the archive_write_zip_data function in archive_write_set_format_zip.c in libarchive 3.1.2 and earlier, when running on 64-bit machines, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors, which triggers an improper conversion between unsigned and signed types, leading to a buffer overflow.
