Tuleap Open ALM is a libre and open source tool for end to end traceability of application and system developments. Prior to version 11.16.99.173 of Community Edition and versions 11.16-6 and 11.15-8 of Enterprise Edition, an attacker with admin rights in one agile dashboard service can execute arbitrary SQL queries. Tuleap Community Edition 11.16.99.173, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 11.16-6, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 11.15-8 contain a patch for this issue.
