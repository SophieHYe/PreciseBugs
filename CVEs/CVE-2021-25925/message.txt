in SiCKRAGE, versions 4.2.0 to 10.0.11.dev1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) due to user input not being validated properly when processed by the server. Therefore, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code inside the application, and possibly steal a user’s sensitive information.
