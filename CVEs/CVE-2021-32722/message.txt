GlobalNewFiles is a mediawiki extension. Versions prior to 48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d are affected by an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability. A large amount of page moves within a short space of time could overwhelm Database servers due to improper handling of load balancing and a lack of an appropriate index. As a workaround, one may avoid use of the extension unless additional rate limit at the MediaWiki level or via PoolCounter / MySQL is enabled. A patch is available in version 48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d.
