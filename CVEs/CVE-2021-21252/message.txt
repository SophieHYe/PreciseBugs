The jQuery Validation Plugin provides drop-in validation for your existing forms. It is published as an npm package "jquery-validation". jquery-validation before version 1.19.3 contains one or more regular expressions that are vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service). This is fixed in 1.19.3.
