Shopware is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and Vue. Permissions set to sales channel context by admin-api are still usable within normal user session. Users are advised to update to the current version 6.4.10.1. For older versions of 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, corresponding security measures are also available via a plugin. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
