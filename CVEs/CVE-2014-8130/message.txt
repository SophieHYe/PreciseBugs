The _TIFFmalloc function in tif_unix.c in LibTIFF 4.0.3 does not reject a zero size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted TIFF image that is mishandled by the TIFFWriteScanline function in tif_write.c, as demonstrated by tiffdither.
