** DISPUTED ** A memory leak in the nfp_abm_u32_knode_replace() function in drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/abm/cls.c in the Linux kernel before 5.3.6 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-78beef629fd9. NOTE: This has been argued as not a valid vulnerability. The upstream commit 78beef629fd9 was reverted.
