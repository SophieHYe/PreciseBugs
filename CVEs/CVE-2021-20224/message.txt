An integer overflow issue was discovered in ImageMagick's ExportIndexQuantum() function in MagickCore/quantum-export.c. Function calls to GetPixelIndex() could result in values outside the range of representable for the 'unsigned char'. When ImageMagick processes a crafted pdf file, this could lead to an undefined behaviour or a crash.
