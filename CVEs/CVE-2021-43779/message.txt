The GLPI addressing plugin in versions < 2.9.1 suffers from authenticated Remote Code Execution vulnerability, allowing access to the server's underlying operating system using command injection abuse of functionality. There is no workaround for this issue and users are advised to upgrade or to disable the addressing plugin.
