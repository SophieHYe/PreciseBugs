= Technical support =

Dear users, our plugins are available for free download. If you have any questions or recommendations regarding the functionality of our plugins (existing options, new options, current issues), please feel free to contact us. Please note that we accept requests in English only. All messages in another languages won't be accepted.

If you notice any bugs in the plugins, you can notify us about it and we'll investigate and fix the issue then. Your request should contain URL of the website, issues description and WordPress admin panel credentials.
Moreover we can customize the plugin according to your requirements. It's a paid service (as a rule it costs $40, but the price can vary depending on the amount of the necessary changes and their complexity). Please note that we could also include this or that feature (developed for you) in the next release and share with the other users then. 
We can fix some things for free for the users who provide translation of our plugin into their native language (this should be a new translation of a certain plugin, you can check available translations on the official plugin page).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `Contact Form` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin using the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress admin panel.
3. You can adjust the necessary settings using your WordPress admin panel in "Settings" > "Contact Form".
4. Create a page or a post and insert the shortcode [contact_form] into the text.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the settings to adjust the plugin work after activation? =

In the 'Plugin' menu you can find a link to the settings page.

= After the plugin installation I haven't adjusted the settings. What is the default email address used for a contact via the form? =

The address specified during WordPress installation will be used by the Contact Form plugin as the default one.

= How can I add Contact Form to my website? =

You should put the shortcode [contact_form] into your page or post.

= I chose a user via the plugin settings and got this error: "Please enter a valid email address. Settings are not saved." =

This means that you made a syntax error.

= How to use some other language files with the Contact Form? = 

Here is an example for the German language files.

1. In order to use another language for WordPress it is necessary to switch the WP version to the required language and in the configuration wp file - `wp-config.php` in the line `define('WPLANG', '');` write `define('WPLANG', 'de_DE');`. If everything is done properly admin panel will be in German.

2. Make sure that there are the files `de_DE.po` and `de_DE.mo` in the plugin (in the languages folder which is in the root of the plugin).

3. If there are no such files you should copy the other files from this folder (for example, for Russian or Italian language) and rename them (you should write `de_DE` instead of `ru_RU` in both files).

4. The files can be edited with the help of the program Poedit - http://www.poedit.net/download.php - please download this program, install it, open the file with this program (required language file) and for each line in English write translation in German.

5. If everything is done properly all lines will be in German in the admin panel and in the front-end.

= How to add the contact form not in English? =

1. Add a language in the block "Language settings for the field names in the form" on the plugin settings page.
2. Mark the check box (if it's not marked yet) in the block  "Change the names of the contact form fields and error messages", choose the necessary tab and fill in the fields. Choose the necessary tab in the block "Action after email is sent" as well and fill in the field. Save the changes.
3. You will see the shortcode under the tab with the necessary language. Please paste that shortcode to the page or post. 

== Screenshots ==

1. Contact Form display.
2. Plugin settings in WordPress admin panel.
3. Contact Form display with additional fields.
4. Plugin settings in WordPress admin panel with additional fields.
5. Widget settings for using shortcode in the sidebar.
