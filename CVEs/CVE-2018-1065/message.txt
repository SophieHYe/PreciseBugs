The netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.15.7 mishandles the case of a rule blob that contains a jump but lacks a user-defined chain, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by leveraging the CAP_NET_RAW or CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, related to arpt_do_table in net/ipv4/netfilter/arp_tables.c, ipt_do_table in net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_tables.c, and ip6t_do_table in net/ipv6/netfilter/ip6_tables.c.
