USOC is an open source CMS with a focus on simplicity. In affected versions USOC allows for SQL injection via usersearch.php. In search terms provided by the user were not sanitized and were used directly to construct a sql statement. The only users permitted to search are site admins. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are not workarounds for this issue.
