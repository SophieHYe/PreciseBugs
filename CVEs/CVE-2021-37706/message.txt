PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In affected versions if the incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the header length is not checked before performing a subtraction operation, potentially resulting in an integer underflow scenario. This issue affects all users that use STUN. A malicious actor located within the victim’s network may forge and send a specially crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary code on the victim’s machine. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known workarounds.
