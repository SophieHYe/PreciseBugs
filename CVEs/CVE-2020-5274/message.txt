In Symfony before versions 5.0.5 and 4.4.5, some properties of the Exception were not properly escaped when the `ErrorHandler` rendered it stacktrace. In addition, the stacktrace were displayed even in a non-debug configuration. The ErrorHandler now escape alls properties of the exception, and the stacktrace is only display in debug configuration. This issue is patched in symfony/http-foundation versions 4.4.5 and 5.0.5
