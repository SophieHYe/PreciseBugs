Socket.io is a realtime application framework that provides communication via websockets. Because socket.io 0.9.6 and earlier depends on `Math.random()` to create socket IDs, the IDs are predictable. An attacker is able to guess the socket ID and gain access to socket.io servers, potentially obtaining sensitive information.
