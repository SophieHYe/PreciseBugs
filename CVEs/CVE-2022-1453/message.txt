The RSVPMaker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL Injection due to missing SQL escaping and parameterization on user supplied data passed to a SQL query in the rsvpmaker-util.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to steal sensitive information from the database in versions up to and including 9.2.5.
