GOST engine is a reference implementation of the Russian GOST crypto algorithms for OpenSSL. TLS clients using GOST engine when ciphersuite `TLS_GOSTR341112_256_WITH_KUZNYECHIK_CTR_OMAC` is agreed and the server uses 512 bit GOST secret keys are vulnerable to buffer overflow. GOST engine version 3.0.1 contains a patch for this issue. Disabling ciphersuite `TLS_GOSTR341112_256_WITH_KUZNYECHIK_CTR_OMAC` is a possible workaround.
