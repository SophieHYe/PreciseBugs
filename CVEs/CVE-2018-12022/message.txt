An issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind prior to 2.7.9.4, 2.8.11.2, and 2.9.6. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for a specific property), the service has the Jodd-db jar (for database access for the Jodd framework) in the classpath, and an attacker can provide an LDAP service to access, it is possible to make the service execute a malicious payload.
