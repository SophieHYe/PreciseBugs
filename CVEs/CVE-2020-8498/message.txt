XSS exists in the shortcode functionality of the GistPress plugin before 3.0.2 for WordPress via the includes/class-gistpress.php id parameter. This allows an attacker with the WordPress Contributor role to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with the privileges of other users (e.g., ones who have the publish_posts capability).
