The acc_ctx_cont function in the SPNEGO acceptor in lib/gssapi/spnego/spnego_mech.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.5.x through 1.12.x before 1.12.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via an empty continuation token at a certain point during a SPNEGO negotiation.
